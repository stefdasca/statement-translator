It seems there was an attempt to reference a file named 'statement-ro.md' which does not exist for Problem ID 266. As a result, I cannot access or translate the specific problem statement you mentioned.

If you can provide the Romanian text of the competitive programming problem statement directly in the chat, I would be happy to help with the translation and formatting as requested.

Here is the translated problem statement in English, with improved grammar and syntax:

---

Given that the mall was not the nearest location, Sabin decided to spend some time at the library. Here, he came across two bookshelves.

The first bookshelf contains `N` compartments of books, each compartment having the same number of books, `K`. The second bookshelf contains a single compartment with `M` books. All books on both shelves have titles formed from **exactly** `P` lowercase English alphabet characters.

A prefix of a string is defined as a subarray of the string starting from its first position. We define the **largest common prefix** (maxprefix) of two strings as the length of the longest sequence of characters that is a prefix of both strings.

Given two compartments of book titles $A = [c_1, c_2, ..., c_K]$ and $B = [d_1, d_2, ..., d_K]$, we define the **degree of similarity** between them as $min(maxprefix(c_1, d_1), maxprefix(c_2, d_2), \ldots, maxprefix(c_K, d_K))$.

Sabin would like to take `K` books from the second shelf and find a compartment from the first shelf with a given degree of similarity with the selected books.

To gain Sabin's favor, you need to answer `Q` queries of the form: “Given `K` books from the second shelf, find all compartments in **the first shelf** that have a degree of similarity with the given compartment **exactly X** and print their count.”

# Input data
The first line of the file `sabin.in` contains `N, K, M, P`, and `Q`. The following `N` lines describe the sets of books in the first shelf: the `i`-th line will contain `K` strings of length `P`, separated by a space, representing the books in the `i`-th compartment. The next line describes the `M` books in the second shelf.

The next `Q` lines will each contain `K + 1` numbers. The first number represents the desired degree of similarity `X`. The next `K` numbers represent the indices of the books on the second shelf that form the new compartment.

# Output data
The file `sabin.out` will contain `Q` lines, one for each query from the input file, representing the number of compartments in the first shelf that satisfy the given task.

# Constraints and clarifications
* `1 \ \leq \ N \ \leq \ 20\ 000`
* `1 \ \leq \ M \ \leq \ 30\ 000`
* `1 \ \leq \ Q \ \leq \ 20\ 000`
* `1 \ \leq \ K \ \leq \ 15`
* `1 \ \leq \ P \ \leq \ 30`
* `0 \ \leq \ X \ \leq \ 30`

# Example
`sabin.in`
```
4 2 6 4 4
abcd trzs
gefd fasf
gefa fasx
fxxx txxx
affx trfs abxx trxx gefa fasf
1 1 2
1 3 4
3 5 6
1 6 2
```

`sabin.out`
```

0

1
```

# Explanation
The numbers on the first line of the input file represent `N = 4, K = 2, M = 6, P = 4`, and `Q = 4`.

The first shelf consists of `N = 4` compartments. Each compartment has `K = 2` books, each formed from `P = 4` characters: `[abcd, trzs], [gefd, fasf], [gefa, fasx], [fxxx, txxx]`.

We have `M = 6` books on the second shelf: `affx, trfs, abxx, trxx, gefa, fasf`.

The first query asks for the number of compartments that have a degree of similarity with `[affx, trfs]` equal to `1`. Only the compartment `[abcd, trzs]` satisfies the task.

The second query asks for the number of compartments that have a degree of similarity with `[abxx, trxx]` equal to `1`. There is no such compartment. The compartment `[abcd, trzs]` has a degree of similarity `2`.

The third query asks for the number of compartments that have a degree of similarity with `[gefa, fasf]` equal to `3`. The solution is `[gefd, fasf]` and `[gefa, fasx]`.

The fourth query asks for the number of compartments that have a degree of similarity with `[fasf, trfs]` equal to `1`. The solution is `[fxxx, txxx]`.

It appears that the content you provided is metadata indicating the absence of a file rather than the actual competitive programming problem statement.

Since no Romanian text was provided for translation, I can't perform the requested translation task. Please provide the competitive programming problem statement in Romanian for me to translate.

Here is the proper structure you could follow for the problem statement:

```
# Titlu Problema

## Cerință

...

## Date de intrare

...

## Date de ieșire

...

## Restricții și precizări

...

```

Once you provide the text, I can proceed with the translation as per your instructions.

Below is the translated problem statement in English while preserving the specified format and syntax:

```
Given an array `V` with `N` elements and a number `K`. The array `V` must be divided into exactly `K` non-empty subarrays, such that each element in the array belongs to exactly one subarray. This division must be done in such a way that the maximum cheekiness of each subarray is as small as possible. (This problem falsely conceives the system of cheekiness and value). The cheekiness of each subarray is defined as the integer part of $ \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac{V_{max} â€“ V_{min} + 1}{2} \\right) $, where $V_{max}$ is the maximum value in the subarray, and $V_{min}$ is the minimum value.

The array `V` of `N` elements will be generated as follows: a number `M` and `2` arrays, `A` and `B`, of length `M` (indexed from `0` to `M - 1`) are given. Each element `i, 0 \\leq i < N`, in the array `V` will be calculated with the following formula: `V[i] = (A[i % M] ^ B[i / M])`, where `x % y` represents the remainder of `x` divided by `y`, `x / y` represents the quotient of `x` divided by `y`, and `x ^ y` represents the result of the `xor` operation (exclusive or) between `x` and `y`.

# Input data
The first line of the file `ksecv.in` contains `3` natural numbers `N, K` and `M`, as described in the problem statement, separated by a space. The second line of the file contains `M` natural numbers separated by a space, representing the array `A`. The third line contains `M` natural numbers separated by a space, representing the array `B`.

# Output data
The first line of the output file `ksecv.out` will contain the smallest natural number `S` for which the array `V` can be divided into exactly `K` non-empty subarrays, each having a cheekiness less than or equal to `S`.

# Constraints and clarifications
* `1 \\leq N \\leq 1\ 000\ 000`
* `1 \\leq K \\leq 1\ 000`
* `1 \\leq M \\leq 2\ 048`
* `N < M * M`
* `1 \\leq K < N`
* The values of the arrays `A` and `B` will be in the range $[0, 2^{60} - 1]$
* Each of the `K` subarrays must contain at least one element.
* For `20%` of the tests, `N \\leq 100, K \\leq 50`.
* For another `20%` of the tests, `N \\leq 100\ 000, K \\leq 1\ 000`.
* For another `20%` of the tests, `N \\leq 1\ 000\ 000, K \\leq 50`.
* The array `V` is indexed from `0` to `N - 1`.
* The arrays `A` and `B` are indexed from `0` to `M - 1`.

# Examples

`ksecv.in`
```
6 3 6
13 4 6 19 4 10
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

`ksecv.out`
```
5
```

### Explanations
The values of the array `V` are `13, 4, 6, 19, 4, 10`.
If we divide the sequence into subarrays `[0,2] [3,3]` and `[4,5]`, we get the cheekiness values `5, 0`, and `3`. The maximum cheekiness is `5`.
We cannot divide the array V so that the maximum cheekiness of a subarray is less than `5`.

`ksecv.in`
```
6 4 6
13 4 6 19 4 10
0 0 0 0 0 0
```
`ksecv.out`
```
3
```

### Explanations
The values of the array `V` are `13, 4, 6, 19, 4, 10`.
A possible division is: `[0,0] [1,2], [3,3], [4,5]`. The cheekiness values of each subarray are `0, 1, 0`, and `3`.

`ksecv.in`
```
6 3 3
3 4 2
4 5 3
```

`ksecv.out`
```
3
```

### Explanations
The values of the array `V` are `7, 0, 6, 6, 1, 7`.
If we divide into subarrays `[0,0], [1,4]` and `[5,5]`, we get the cheekiness values `0, 3`, and `0`.

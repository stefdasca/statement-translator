It appears that the competitive programming problem statement file 'statement-ro.md' you are referring to does not exist for Problem ID 249. The content of the text you provided does not include any specific problem statement that I can translate.

Could you please provide the actual Romanian problem statement text or another method to access it? This will allow me to carry out the translation and formatting tasks as requested.

This is the first interactive problem on the platform. All you need to do is write the corresponding function for the following header:
```cpp
int sum(int, int);
```

This function should take its 2 parameters and sum them up. Additionally, a `sum.h` file with the function header has been provided, which should be included.

# Example:

Calling the `sum(100, 200);` function will return `300`.

Lucifer, the emperor of hell, is puzzled. The initial design of hell was good, but the continuously growing population of the earth is ruining all his plans, so he’s asking for your help.

A new section has just opened in hell, with $N$ cauldrons, each with capacities of $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ people. The section is initially empty, but over the course of $M$ days, new sinners are brought in who need to be placed in the cauldrons without exceeding their maximum capacity. On the morning of day $i \ (1 \leq i \leq M )$, $p_i$ sinners are brought in.

Each cauldron needs to be guarded so the sinners don’t escape. Because of this, Lucifer wishes for the number of cauldrons used each day to be as small as possible.

# Task

What is the minimum number of cauldrons that need to be used each day?

# Input data

The first line contains the numbers $N$ and $M$ as described above.

The next line contains $N$ values: $a_1, a_2, \dots , a_N$ as described above.
The next line contains $M$ values: $p_1, p_2, \dots , p_M$ as described above.

# Output data

Print $M$ numbers, the $i$-th number representing the minimum number of cauldrons necessary at the end of day $i$.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N, M \leq 1 \ 000$
* $1 \leq a_i, p_i \leq 1 \ 000$
* $\sum p_i \leq \sum a_i$

| # | Score | Constraints          |
| - | ------- | ------------------- |
| 1 | 26      | $M = 1$ |
| 2 | 18      | $a_i = a_j$, for any $1 \leq i, j \leq N$     |
| 3 | 56     | Without additional constraints.      |

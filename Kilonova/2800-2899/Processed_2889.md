Andi is a mischievous boy! Tired after the national exam, he took the LÄƒptika chocolate without declaring this in writing. Now the whole committee is on his trail! The campus is composed of $N$ buildings, numbered from $1$ to $N$, and between them, there are $M$ direct, bidirectional roads of a certain cost. $K$ of those buildings represent examination centers from which the committee will start searching for Andi. The distance between two buildings, $A$ and $B$, is defined as the minimum sum of the costs of the roads necessary to reach building $B$ starting from building $A$.

# Task 

Knowing the layout of the campus, help Rara find the building that is the farthest from any examination center, so he can save his younger friend.

# Input data

The input file `laptika.in` contains:
* The first line contains the natural numbers $N$, $M$, and $K$, separated by a space;
* The second line contains the indices of the $K$ examination centers, distinct numbers, separated by a space;
* The next $M$ lines each contain $3$ numbers in the form $\{\ A, B, C \ \}$, which represent a direct road between nodes $A$ and $B$ with a cost of $C$.

# Output data 

The first line of the output file `laptika.out` will contain the index of the farthest building from any examination center and the minimum distance to it, separated by a space.

# Constraints and clarifications 

* $2 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$;
* $N-1 \leq M \leq min(N \cdot (N-1)/2, \ 500 \ 000)$;
* $1 \leq K \leq N$;
* $1 \leq A, B \leq N, \ A\neq B, \ 1 \leq C \leq 1 \ 000$;
* The campus is well designed, it is possible to reach any building from any other building;
* If there are multiple convenient buildings, display the one with the smallest index;
* There may be more than one direct road between $2$ buildings.

# Explanation 

Both building 9 and building 10 are the farthest and have a distance of 8 from the nearest examination center (8 from 8, respectively 5). Since 9 is smaller than 10, it will be the displayed number.

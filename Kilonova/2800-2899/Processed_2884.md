It appears there was an issue with retrieving the file contents for translation as indicated by the message:

```
Attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 2884.
```

This means I don't have access to the actual problem statement text in Romanian that you want to be translated.

Could you please provide the text of the competitive programming problem statement directly here, so I can assist you with the translation and proper formatting?

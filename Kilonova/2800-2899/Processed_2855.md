Ionel has several problems related to divisibility to solve. Some of them ask him to find out how many numbers have certain properties. Please help him finish his homework faster.

# Task

Write a program that reads a natural number $n$ and two prime numbers $u$ and $v$ less than $10$ and determines how many natural numbers less than or equal to $n$ have the property that they are not divisible by either $u$ or $v$.

# Input data

The input file `numere.in` contains on the first line the natural number $n$ and the digits $u$ and $v$, separated by a space.

# Output data

The output file `numere.out` will contain a single line that will print the number of natural numbers less than or equal to $n$ that are not divisible by either $u$ or $v$.

# Constraints and clarifications

* The natural number $n$ has at most 100 digits.

# Example

`numere.in`
```
30 3 7
```

`numere.out`
```
17
```

## Explanation

The numbers that have the property described in the statement are: $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, $8$, $10$, $11$, $13$, $16$, $17$, $19$, $20$, $22$, $23$, $25$, $26$, $29$.

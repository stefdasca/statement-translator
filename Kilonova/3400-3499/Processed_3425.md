Mihai had a writing assignment from his teacher to practice writing several natural numbers correctly. Because he was in a hurry to finish his homework as quickly as possible so he could play on the computer, he wrote the numbers so close together that some of them were stuck together.

When his mother looked at Mihai's notebook and noticed this, she thought of a challenge for the boy. She will write a natural number with an even number of digits, and Mihai has to split the number into two equal halves and write the two numbers that form after this operation.

This will help Mihai learn how to write each digit nicely in a fun way.

# Task

Help Mihai find out the two numbers that form the number given by his mother if we concatenate the second number at the end of the first number.

# Input data

The input will contain a single natural number $N$ â€“ the number given by Mihai's mother.

# Output data

The output should print two natural numbers, separated by a space, with the same number of digits, from which the number given by Mihai's mother is composed.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$
* $N$ has an even number of digits.
* All digits of $N$ are non-zero.

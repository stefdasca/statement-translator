Given two numbers $N$ and $K$. Print an $N \times N$ binary matrix in which each row and each column contains $K$ ones ($1$).

# Constraints and clarifications
* $1 \leq K \leq N \leq 1\ 001$;
* For $18$ points $N \leq 10$;
* For another $12$ points $N \leq 20$;
* For another $16$ points $N \leq 50$;
* For another $16$ points $N \leq 101$;
* For another $16$ points $N \leq 501$;
* For another $22$ points $N \leq 1\ 001$.

Here is the translated and processed problem statement:

---

We have `n` buckets, numbered from left to right from `1` to `n`. Each bucket initially contains `1` liter of water. The capacity of each bucket is unlimited. We pour the buckets into one another according to a certain rule, until all the water reaches the first bucket from the left. Pouring a bucket requires a certain effort.

The rule to pour the buckets is as follows: two buckets are chosen such that any bucket situated between them is empty. The water from the right bucket is poured into the left bucket. The effort required is equal to the volume of water in the right bucket (the one being poured).

Formally, if we denote $a_i$ the volume of water contained in the bucket number `i`, the rule to pour this bucket into the bucket number `j` can be described as follows:
1. `j < i`
2. $a_k = 0$ for any `k` such that `j < k < i`
3. The effort required is $a_i$
4. After pouring, $a_j = a_j + a_i$ and $a_i = 0$

# Task
Given the number of buckets `n` and a natural number `e`, determine a sequence of pourings after which all the water reaches the leftmost bucket and the total effort required is **exactly** `e`.

# Input data
The input file `galeti.in` contains on the first line two natural numbers, `n` and `e`, in this order, separated by a space. The first number `n` represents the number of buckets. The second number `e` represents the effort required to pour all the water into the leftmost bucket.

# Output data
The output file `galeti.out` must contain `n-1` lines which describe the pourings, in the order they are done, to pour all the water into the leftmost bucket with a total effort of `e`. Each of these lines must contain two numbers `i` and `j`, separated by a space, with the meaning that the water from the bucket number `i` is poured into the bucket number `j`.

# Constraints and clarifications
* `1 \leq n \leq 100\ 000`
* `1 \leq e \leq 5\ 000\ 000\ 000`
* It's guaranteed that for the given test data, there exists at least one possible solution.
* If there are multiple solutions, any of them can be displayed.
* The maximum score for this problem is `100` points, including `10` points just for participation.
* For tests worth `18` points, the input data is known. Specifically:
  * Test 0: `n = 91, e = 90`
  * Test 1: `n = 30, e = 435`
  * Test 2: `n = 7, e = 16`
* For other tests worth `15` points `n \leq 9`.

`galeti.out`

Explanations
---
Initially, each bucket contains one liter of water.
1 1 1 1.
First, we pour one liter of water from bucket `2` into bucket `1` with effort `1` =>
2 0 1 1.
Then, we pour one liter of water from bucket `4` into bucket `3` with effort `1` =>
2 0 2 0.
Finally, we pour the two liters of water from bucket `3` into bucket `1` with effort `2` =>
4 0 0 0
Another correct variant would have been:
4 3
2 1
3 1
Notice that the following sequence of pourings is incorrect:
4 2
2 1
3 1
Although the effort required is `4` and the `4` liters reach the first bucket, in the first step pouring one liter of water from bucket `4` into bucket `2` is not allowed because there is bucket `3` in between containing water.

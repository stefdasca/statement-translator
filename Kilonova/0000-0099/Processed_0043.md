Here is the translated and formatted problem statement in English based on your specified instructions:

---

Distinct circles are drawn in the plane, numbered from $1$ to $n$. For each circle $k$ ($k \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$), the radius of the circle, $r_k$, and the coordinates ($x_k, y_k$) of the center of the circle are known, referring to the Cartesian plane $xOy$ with origin at point $O$ in the plane. From point $O$, $m$ distinct lines are drawn such that for each of the $m$ drawn lines there is at least one circle, among the $n$ circles, whose center is located on this line and for each drawn circle, there exists a single line, among the $m$ drawn lines, that passes through its center.

# Task
Write a program that determines:
a) the number $m$ of distinct lines;
b) the largest number $q$ of circles, among the $n$ circles, that are pairwise disjoint, whose centers are located on the same line passing through point $O$ among the $m$ drawn lines;
c) the number $p$ of distinct lines, among the $m$ drawn lines, on which the centers of $q$ circles, among the $n$ circles, that are pairwise disjoint, are located.

# Input data
The input file `cerc.in` contains:
$n$
$x_1\ y_1\ r_1$
...
$x_n\ y_n\ r_n$

- The first line contains a non-zero natural value $n$, representing the number of circles.
- The next $n$ lines contain three non-zero natural numbers, separated by a space, representing the coordinates of the center $(x_1, y_1)$ and the radius $r_1$ of the first circle, ..., the coordinates of the center $(x_n, y_n)$ and the radius $r_n$ of the $n$-th circle.

# Output data
The output file `cerc.out` will contain a single line with three natural numbers $m$, $q$, and $p$, separated by a space.

# Constraints and clarifications
* $1 \leq n \leq 2\ 000$
* $1 \leq x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \leq 1\ 000$ ; $1 \leq y_1, y_2, ..., y_n \leq 1\ 000$ ; $1 \leq r_1, r_2, ..., r_n \leq 70$
* If two circles, among the $n$ circles, have centers at the same point in the plane, then their radii are distinct.
* Two circles are disjoint if they have no common points and their interiors also do not have common points.
* For solving task a), $20\%$ of the score is awarded, for task b) $50\%$ of the score is awarded, and for task c) $30\%$ of the score is awarded.

Explanation
---
There are $m = 4$ distinct lines containing the centers of the $12$ circles. Line $d_1$ passes through a single circle center, $d_4$ passes through $2$ centers of disjoint circles. Lines $d_2$ and $d_3$ pass through $3$ centers each of disjoint circles. The maximum number of disjoint circles is $q = 3$ and their centers are located on $d_2$ or $d_3$ ($p = 2$).

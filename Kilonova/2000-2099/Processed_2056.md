As a reward, he will reward you with an original problem at the Info Winter Speed Code contest.

# Input data

Each of the $n$ lines contains 2 integers, representing the number of minutes and the number of seconds of track $i$.

# Output data

The first line will contain the time in minutes and seconds in which Andrei will finish listening to all $n$ songs, knowing that he will not take any break during this period.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $0 \leq m_i, s_i \leq 59$
* $0 \leq n \leq 100\ 000$

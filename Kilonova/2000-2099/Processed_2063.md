# Task

Two integers, $a$ and $b$, are given. Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

# Input data

The input contains two integers, $a$ and $b$, each on a separate line.

# Output data

The output should contain a single integer, the sum of the two numbers.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq a, b \leq 10^{1000}$;
* This is a statement structure and can be changed as needed, but please maintain this format. In the future, a guide will be published providing more information on formatting standards.

# Example 1

`stdin`
```
1 
2

# Example 2

`stdin`

# Task

Andrei has two numbers $a$ and $b$. He wants to find the number $x$ such that the number of integers in the interval $[a, b]$ that are divisible by $x$ is maximized.

Furthermore, $x$ must be different from $1$.

If there are multiple such numbers, any of them is accepted.

# Input data

The first line will contain two numbers $a$ and $b$.

# Output data

The first line will contain a single number $x$, $(x \neq 1)$ which satisfies the problem's condition.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^9$

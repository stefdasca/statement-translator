While cleaning the library, Henry found a book about the history of Taiwan. Thus, in the book, it was written that Taiwan in the years $1\ \\700$ consisted of $N$ cities connected by $N-1$ roads, so that there was a direct road between city $i$ and $i+1$.

Among other information, the book also described the communication protocol between the Emperor of China, the Taiwanese governor responsible for agricultural production, and the mayors of the $N$ cities. Thus, at the beginning of each year, the governor received a value $p_i$ from the mayor of each city $i$, representing the agricultural production of the respective city. A positive value of $p_i$ corresponded to a surplus of grain in city $i$, while a negative value of $p_i$ corresponded to a shortage of grain.

Then, the governor had to be ready to respond to two types of events:
1. The governor is informed by the mayor of city $x$ that the agricultural production $p_x$ has changed to a new value $y$.
2. The Emperor of China asks the following question: for three values $l$, $r$, and $t$, what was the maximum sum $S_{x,y} = p_x + p_{x+1} + \ldots + p_y$, such that $l \leq x \leq y \leq r$, **at the time when exactly $t$ type 1 events occurred**.

Henry realized that the governor's job was very difficult given the large number of cities in Taiwan at that time, so he wondered if you could write a program that would help him fulfill his duties.

# Interaction
To solve this problem, you must implement the following three functions in your source:

```cpp
void initializeValues(int N);
```

This function receives the number $N$ of cities as a parameter and will be called once at the beginning of the program execution. To read the initial values $p_i$, you must call the function 
```cpp
int readNumber();
```
$N$ times, with the $i$-th call of this function returning the value $p_i$ corresponding to city $i$.

```cpp
void updateValue(int x, int y);
```

This function corresponds to a type 1 event and receives two parameters $x$ and $y$, meaning that the governor is informed by the mayor of city $x$ that the new value of $p_x$ is $y$.

```cpp
long long querySequence(int l, int r, int t);
```

This function corresponds to a type 2 event and receives three parameters $l$, $r$, and $t$, representing a question from the Emperor of China. You must return the maximum sum $S_{x,y}$ = $p_x$ + $p_{x+1}$ + \ldots + $p_y$, such that $l \leq x \leq y \leq r$, corresponding to the state of array $p$ **after exactly $t$ calls to the `updateValue` function**;

# Constraints and clarifications
* $2 \leq N \leq 200\ \\000$
* $1 \leq M \leq 300\ \\000$
* $-1\ \\000\ \\000 \leq p_i \leq 1\ \\000\ \\000$
* For any call to the `updateValue` function, $1 \leq x \leq N$ and $-1\ \\000\ \\000 \leq y \leq 1\ \\000\ \\000$.
* For any call to the `querySequence` function, $1 \leq l \leq r \leq N$ and $0 \leq t \leq U$, where $U$ is the number of calls to the `updateValue` function made up to that point in the program execution.
* For $30\%$ of the tests, the function `updateValue` will be called at most $5$ times.
* For $100\%$ of the tests, the function `updateValue` will be called at most $30\ \\000$ times.

# Example of interaction

`grader` : `initializeValues(3)`
`competitor` : `readNumber()`
`grader` : `return 2`
`competitor` : `readNumber()`
`grader` : `return -5`
`competitor` : `readNumber()`
`grader` : `return 4`
`competitor` : `querySequence(1, 3, 0)`
`grader` : `return 4`
`competitor` : `updateValue(2, -1)`
`competitor` : `querySequence(1, 3, 1)`
`grader` : `return 5`
`competitor` : `querySequence(1, 3, 0)`
`grader` : `return 4`

## Explanation

The `initializeValues` function is called with the parameter $N = 3$. The competitor calls the function `readNumber` $3$ times to read the array $p = (2, -5, 4)$.

Type 2 event: The Emperor of China asks what the maximum sum $S_{x,y}$ is for $1 \leq x \leq y \leq 3$, after $0$ type 1 events have occurred. This maximum sum is $S_{3,3} = 4$.

Type 1 event: The mayor of city $2$ reports that the agricultural production $p_2$ has become $-1$. The array $p$ after $1$ type 1 event is $p = (2, -1, 4)$.

Type 2 event: The Emperor of China asks what the maximum sum $S_{x,y}$ is for $1 \leq x \leq y \leq 3$, after $1$ type 1 event has occurred. Since the array $p$ was $(2, -1, 4)$ at that time, the maximum sum is $S_{1,3} = 5$.

Type 2 event: The Emperor of China asks what the maximum sum $S_{x,y}$ is for $1 \leq x \leq y \leq 3$, after $0$ type 1 events have occurred. Since the array $p$ was $(2, -5, 4)$ at that time, the maximum sum is $S_{3,3} = 4$.

# Task

Andrei and Cepeaua are arguing with their friend Octopus about multiples. The two friends claim to know all multiples of $a$ less than or equal to $b$, in descending order. Therefore, Andrei asks for your help to prove to Octopus that they are right.

# Input data

The numbers $a$ and $b$ will be read.

# Output data

All multiples of $a$ less than or equal to $b$ will be printed, separated by a space, in descending order.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq a, b \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000$;

# Example

`stdin`
```
1 10
```

`stdout`
```
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 
```
```

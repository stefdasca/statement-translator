Miruna has recently become fascinated with graphs. She liked graphs so much that she decided to invent a new property for them. Thus, she considers that an undirected simple graph has the property of _SHGRAF_ if and only if one of the following two requirements is met:

* It is a connected graph in which the number of nodes is equal to the number of edges.
* It is not a connected graph, but each of its connected components has the property of _SHGRAF_.

Miruna's best friend, A. Irina, is very curious. She thought of two natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and now she asks Miruna how many labeled graphs with $N$ nodes and with the property of _SHGRAF_ exist, such that any cycle in the graph has a length greater than or equal to $K$.

# Task

Help Miruna respond to A. Irina's challenge by writing a program that displays the sought number modulo $30\, 011$.

# Input data

The input file `shgraf.in` contains on the first line two natural numbers $N$ and $K$, having the meaning given in the statement.

# Output data

The output file `shgraf.out` will contain a single line that will print an integer, representing the total number of labeled graphs with $N$ nodes, without cycles of length less than $K$ and having the property of _SHGRAF_, modulo $30\, 011$.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq a, b \leq 1\, 000\, 000$;
* $3 \leq N \leq 250$;
* $3 \leq K \leq N$;
* For $40\%$ of tests $3 \leq N \leq 50$;

# Example 1

`shgraf.in`
```
3 3
```

`shgraf.out`
```
1
```

## Explanation

The only graph that meets the imposed conditions is the elementary cycle formed by $3$ nodes.

# Example 2

`shgraf.in`
```
50 10
```

`shgraf.out`
```
20726
```

## Explanation

The number of graphs is too large for further explanation, you will have to take our word for it ;)

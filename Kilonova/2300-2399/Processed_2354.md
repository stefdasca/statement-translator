On June 1st, the City Hall of a town is organizing a competition between schools. Each school participates in the competition with $2n$ children dressed in shirts that have a number from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ on the back, so that the number $1$ appears on two shirts, the number $2$ on two shirts, and so on, the number $n$ appears on two shirts.

The leader of the group of children from each school has the task of arranging all the children in a straight line such that between any two children with the same number $k$ on their shirts, there are exactly $k$ children $(k=1, 2, \ldots, n)$. The competition is won by the school that arranges the children to respect the aforementioned rule.

# Task
It is required to determine, for any non-zero natural number $n<70$, in the form $4k$ or $4k+3$, a way to arrange the $2n$ children of a school, which respects the rule from the statement.

# Input data
Your program does not read any data.

# Output data
The output file you will upload will contain at most $34$ lines, one line for each possible value of $n$. The first number on each line is the value of $n$, after which, on the same line, the numbers that represent a way to arrange the $2n$ students while respecting the conditions in the statement will be written with a space between them. The values of $n$ will be distinct non-zero natural numbers $< 70$, in the form $4k$ or $4k+3$. The order of lines in the file does not matter.

# Example
The line corresponding to $n=3$ in the output file may be (this is not the only solution):
```
3 3 1 2 1 3 2
```

# Observations
Partial points are awarded. For $n=3$, no points are awarded :-)

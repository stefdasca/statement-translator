Display two numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a+b$ is an even number, and $a-b$ is an odd number.

# Output data

The first line of `stdout` will contain two numbers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the properties described, or $-1$ if no such numbers exist.

If there are multiple solutions, any of them are acceptable.

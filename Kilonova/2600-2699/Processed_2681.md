It appears that the file contents provided do not contain an actual problem statement in Romanian, but rather a message indicating that a specific "statement-ro.md" file does not exist for a given Problem ID.

To proceed with your request, I would need the actual content of the problem statement in Romanian.

Please provide the problem statement text, and I will translate it for you while preserving the specified syntax and structure.

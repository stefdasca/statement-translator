It appears there's a message indicating that the file `statement-ro.md` attached to Problem ID 2685 does not exist. Without access to the text content of the problem statement, I am unable to perform the translation and formatting tasks as requested. 

Could you provide the actual text of the problem statement you need translated? This way, I can help you process it accordingly.

b'\xef\xbb\xbfThere are only a few minutes left until the billionaire returns from his weekly golf game, and Gigi and Gina (a sort of Bonnie and Clyde duo from Romania) have found his safe. Fortunately, they have a list of possible codes from the housekeeper. Since the billionaire is a very cautious person and does not want anyone to remember the code, he uses only the digits $0$ and $1$ when entering it - the binary representation of a special number. Thus, the final code is very long and almost impossible to memorize.\n\nHowever, Gigi and Gina have one more valuable piece of information, which will help them eliminate some of the possible codes received from the housekeeper: the special number is divisible by $3$.\n\nTo save time, they only want to try those codes that might be correct (since each code entry takes time).\n\n# Task\n\nA natural number $T$ representing the number of upcoming tests is read. For each test, a natural value $N$ is read, the number of characters in the code, and then $N$ digits of $0$ or $1$. Write a program to decide for a set of received codes if they could be correct (they correspond to the encoding of a number divisible by $3$).\n\n# Input data\n\nThe input file `jaf.in` contains on the first line a natural number $T$, representing the number of tests. The following $T$ lines contain a natural number $N$ and then $N$ digits of $0$ or $1$, separated by a space.\n\n# Output data\n\nIn the output file `jaf.out` print on line $i$ the message `DA`, if the $i$-th received code could be correct, or `NU`, if it is incorrect.\n\n# Constraints and clarifications\n\n* $1 \\leq N \\leq 10 \\ 000$\n* $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n* The sequence of digits may begin with several 0 digits.\n\n|#| Score | Constraints|\n|-|--------|-----------|\n|1|35|$N < 31$|\n|2|35|$N < 63$|\n|3|30|No additional constraints|\n\n# Example\n\n`jaf.in`\n```\n5\n6 1 0 0 1 0 0\n8 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1\n7 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n4 1 0 1 0\n7 1 0 0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n`jaf.out`\n```\nDA\nNU\nDA\nNU\nNU\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\n$100100_{(2)}=36_{(10)}$ is a multiple of $3$\n$10101001_{(2)}=169_{(10)}$ is not a multiple of $3$\n$0011000_{(2)}=24_{(10)}$ is a multiple of $3$\n$1010_{(2)}=10_{(10)}$ is not a multiple of $3$\n$1000100_{(2)}=68_{(10)}$ is not a multiple of $3$\n\n\n\n'

It appears that the content provided is an error message indicating that the attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 2600. Because the problem statement in Romanian is missing, I'm unable to process and translate it as requested. 

However, if you can provide the actual content of the problem statement in Romanian, I would be happy to help translate it into English, maintaining the specified formatting and naming conventions. Please provide the text of the problem statement, and I will proceed with the translation.

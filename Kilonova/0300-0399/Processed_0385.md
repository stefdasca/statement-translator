It appears that the file "statement-ro.md" for Problem ID 385 is missing or does not exist. Without access to the actual problem statement in Romanian, I'm unable to proceed with the translation.

If you can provide the text of the problem statement in Romanian, I'd be happy to assist with the translation as per your instructions. Please copy and paste the text here so I can help you further.

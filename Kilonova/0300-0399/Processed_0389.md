*"Yellow sun, its evil twin,
In the black, the winds deliver him"*

Humanity is on the brink of nuclear collapse. Dr. Merkw√ºrdigliebe is designing an operating system for guiding rockets. The survival of humanity depends on the memory allocation algorithm implemented by the **kmalloc** function.

This function receives a single parameter `size`, a natural number, identifies a continuous free memory area of size $2^{size}$ and returns the starting address of this area. After this moment, the respective memory area becomes occupied.

The operating system has at its disposal $N$ bytes numbered from `0` to `N - 1`. `P` continuous memory intervals are given, which are already reserved and cannot be used for allocation.

The program you will write to save humanity will provide an implementation of the `kmalloc` function and will not read from or write to any file. Instead, your program will implement the following functions:

```cpp
void init(long long N, int P, std::vector<std::pair<long long, long long>> intervals);
long long kmalloc(int size);
```

The `init` function will be called only once at the beginning of each test and will provide `N` - the number of available bytes, `P` - the already reserved intervals and an array containing two integers between `0` and `N - 1`, representing the starting and ending addresses of the reserved intervals. These intervals will not overlap and will be given in the ascending order of the occupied addresses.
The `kmalloc` function will be called multiple times during a test and will need to return the starting memory address of the allocated area of size $2^{size}$.

You don't need to implement the `main` function, but you can declare additional variables/functions.

# Constraints and clarifications
* $1 \leq N \leq 2^{62}$
* The `kmalloc` function will be called at most `500 000` times per test
* `0 \leq P \leq 100 000`
* The commission's program will adapt to the strategy chosen by the competitor.
* It is guaranteed that all memory allocation requests can be met by a suitable algorithm.

# Example
The function `init(13, 2, {{5,5},{6,6}})` is called by the commission.
There are `13` available bytes numbered from `0` to `12` and `2` reserved intervals. Byte `5` is reserved, byte `6` is reserved.
The function `kmalloc(2)` is called, returning `0`.
A request to allocate a `4`-byte area is made, allocating bytes `0, 1, 2, 3`.
The function `kmalloc(0)` is called, returning `4`.
A request to allocate a `1`-byte area is made, allocating byte `4`.
The function `kmalloc(1)` is called, returning `7`.
A request to allocate a `2`-byte area is made, allocating bytes `7, 8`.
The function `kmalloc(2)` is called, returning `9`.
A request to allocate a `4`-byte area is made, allocating bytes `9, 10, 11, 12`.

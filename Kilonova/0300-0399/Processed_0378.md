It appears there was an issue referencing the problem statement, possibly due to a missing or inaccessible file named `statement-ro.md`. This file may contain the Romanian text that needs to be processed.

Without access to that file, I'm unable to directly translate the problem statement as requested. If you can provide the text from the problem statement, I can proceed with the translation and formatting instructions. Please paste the text here, and I'll take care of the translation for you.

It seems like there's an error message indicating that the attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 302. This suggests that the file containing the Romanian problem statement is missing or incorrectly referenced.

Please provide the actual content of the competitive programming problem statement in Romanian, so I can proceed with the translation according to your specifications. Alternatively, if there is a corrected path or a text snippet, include that as well.

It seems like the text you provided doesn't contain an actual problem statement in Romanian. Instead, it contains a message that an attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 387.

If you could provide the actual content of the problem statement in Romanian, I'd be more than happy to translate it for you according to the specified instructions. Here’s a reminder of the format and structure you mentioned:

1. **Cerință** should be translated as **Task**.
2. **Date de intrare** should be translated as **Input data**.
3. **Date de ieșire** should be translated as **Output data**.
4. **subsecvență** should be translated as **subarray**.
5. **subșir** should be translated as **subsequence**.
6. **Restricții și precizări** should be translated as **Constraints and clarifications**.
7. **vector** should be translated as **array**.
8. Use the verb **contain** in the **Input data** and **Output data** sections to describe the data we need to read or print.
9. For large integers, use a backslash followed and preceded by a single space character to separate groups of 3 digits in LaTeX/MathJax mode.
10. Preserve the custom image format exactly as it is.

Please provide the Romanian problem statement, and I will proceed with the translation while preserving the specified details and syntax requirements.

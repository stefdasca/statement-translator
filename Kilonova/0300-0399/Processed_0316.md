It appears that the text provided is indicating that an attachment named 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for the given Problem ID. Thus, I'm unable to view or process the content of the competitive programming problem statement written in Romanian.

However, if you provide the actual text from the competitive programming problem statement in Romanian here directly, I would be happy to translate it as per your instructions.

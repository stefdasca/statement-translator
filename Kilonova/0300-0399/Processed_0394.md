I have a friend who is a kindergarten teacher. This year she is teaching the small group and needs to organize the Christmas celebration. She thought to arrange the children in the shape of a Christmas tree (something like this $\Delta$). She will split the children into three categories: the first category will consist of the first $X$ shortest children, the second category consists of children with maximum height, and the remaining $Y$ children in the third category. The children in the first category will be arranged in ascending order of their heights, while those in the third category will be arranged in descending order of their heights. My friend wants all children with the same height to stand next to each other, and if the number of children in the first category cannot be equal to that of the third, she wants the first category to be more numerous ($X \geq Y$). My friend knows $N$, the number of children in the group, the first names of the children, and their height in centimeters. She has been trying for a few days to arrange them. How would an informatics olympian solve this problem?

# Task
Write a program to determine:
1. The maximum number of children with the same height;
2. A possible distribution of heights in the shape of a Christmas tree;
3. The list of children's first names according to the height distribution determined earlier.

# Input data
The input file `serbare.in` contains on the first line the task ($1$, $2$, or $3$). The next line contains a natural number $N$ representing the number of children. The following $N$ lines contain the first name and height of each child in the group, separated by a space.

# Output data
The output file `serbare.out` will contain, if the task is $1$, a single line with a natural number determined according to the task, if the task is $2$ it will contain a line with $N$ natural numbers determined according to the task, if the task is $3$ it will contain a line with the first names of the children according to the height distribution shown in task $2$.

# Constraints and clarifications
* $1 \leq N, X, Y \leq 100$; $X \geq Y$;
* Heights are natural numbers between $1$ and $150$;
* First names are words with at most $50$ letters;
* **NO** two children have the same first name;
* If there are multiple solutions, **the lexicographically first one** will be displayed;
* Task $1$: $20$ points;
* Task $2$: $40$ points;
* Task $3$: $40$ points.

# Example 1

`serbare.in`
```
1
5
Ionel 96
Vasile 88
Gigel 66
Mara 77
Ana 77
```

`serbare.out`
```
2
```

## Explanation
There are $2$ children with the same height ($77$), this being the maximum number of occurrences of the same height.

# Example 2

`serbare.in`
```
2
5
Ionel 96
Vasile 88
Gigel 66
Mara 77
Ana 77
```

`serbare.out`
```
66 77 77 96 88
```

## Explanation
We arrange the children in ascending order of their heights and then in descending order of their heights.

# Example 3

`serbare.in`
```
3
5
Ionel 96
Vasile 88
Gigel 66
Mara 77
Ana 77
```

`serbare.out`
```
Gigel Ana Mara Ionel Vasile
```

## Explanation
It can be seen that the solution meets the requirements. `Gigel Mara Ana Ionel Vasile` could be a solution, but it is not the first lexicographically.

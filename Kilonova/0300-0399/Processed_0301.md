It appears that there's no competitive programming problem statement text provided for translation. The content mentions that the file "statement-ro.md" does not exist for Problem ID 301. Therefore, I'm unable to perform the translation task as specified because there is no actual problem statement to translate.

If you could provide the Romanian problem statement text directly, I would be happy to help with the translation. Please paste the text of the problem statement here, and I'll proceed with translating it according to the instructions you've given.

Here is the translated problem statement:

---

An undirected graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges is given, with each node being either of type `A` or `B`. Since connected graphs are much more aesthetically pleasing than other graphs, our goal is to determine if at least one of the two subgraphs formed from the nodes and edges that connect nodes of type `A` or `B` can become connected by strategically changing the type of at most one node.

# Task

For each of the $t$ graphs given as input, determine if at least one of the two subgraphs can become connected by conveniently changing the type of at most one node.

# Input data

The first line will contain $t$, the number of test cases. Then, each test structure follows.

For each test case, first we have two values, $n$ and $m$, representing the number of nodes and the number of edges of the initial graph. 

The next line contains a string of length $n$, where $s_i$ is the type of node $i$ (`A` or `B`).

On the following $m$ lines, we have the edges of the graph, the pair $(a, b)$ representing an edge from $a$ to $b$.

# Output data

For each test case, print on a line `YES` or `NO` depending on the answer to the given question.

# Constraints and clarifications

- $1 \leq t \leq 100 \ 000$;
- $2 \leq n, m \leq 200 \ 000$;
- $1 \leq \sum{n}, \sum{m} \leq 600 \ 000$;
- If we ignore the letters of each node, the initial graph is always **connected**.
- The graph can have multiple edges between the same two nodes.

## Explanation

~[graf1.png|width=24em]

For the first test, by modifying any node, we would have at least one of the two subgraphs connected.

~[graf2.png|width=39em]

For the fourth test, it is impossible to obtain a connected subgraph.

It seems that the file contents provided are not the actual problem statement, but rather an error message indicating that the attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 1617. 

To proceed with translating the problem statement from Romanian to English as per your instructions, I would need the actual content of the problem statement. Could you please provide the text of the problem statement you want translated?

Once you provide the text, I'll be able to carry out the translation and format preservation as specified.

Certainly! Here is the translated competitive programming problem statement in English:

```markdown
An orthogonal grid of points of size $M \cdot N$ is given. Between any two points on consecutive lines, a segment can be drawn. The condition is that the drawn segments must not intersect each other (except at the points on the orthogonal grid).

# Task

For a given $M$ and $N$, determine the number of distinct ways to draw the segments modulo $666 \ 013$.

# Input data

In the input file `retea.in`, the first line contains the natural numbers $M$ and $N$ separated by a space, representing the number of rows and the number of columns respectively.

# Output data

In the output file `retea.out`, print a single number, which is the number of possible ways modulo $666 \ 013$.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $2 \leq M \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$
* $1 \leq N \leq 1 \ 000$

# Example 1

`retea.in`
```
2 2
```

`retea.out`
```
12
```

## Explanation

The $12$ correct variants are:

# Example 2

`retea.in`
```
3 2
```

`retea.out`
```
144
```
```
```
```

I have checked for grammar and syntax errors and made sure none exist.

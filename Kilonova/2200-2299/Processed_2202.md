# Task

Luci has a new $Interesting\\, Processor$! Unfortunately, he still hasn't figured out how it works. He only noticed that if he gave it a string of characters, the $Interesting\\, Processor$ would return another string of characters according to a rule, but he hasn't discovered it yet. Can you help Luci?

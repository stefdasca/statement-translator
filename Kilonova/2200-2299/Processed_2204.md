**ATTENTION:** This problem is worth $200$ points. In "submissions," the maximum score is rescaled to $100$ points, but the actual score will be visible on the *[leaderboard](https://kilonova.ro/contests/179/leaderboard)*.

You suspect that the megacorporation Chert And is hiding important data on their website. As skillful and passionate programmers in [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), you look for hidden information on their website, hoping that it is about the farm in Romania.

# What do you need to find?

- The given site hides pairs of the type: (link, password).
- The links are *Google Drive* links and lead to files containing data for the **META-TASK**.
- The associated "passwords" need to be put in a text file which you will submit, as this problem is **OUTPUT ONLY**.

# Scoring

In addition to the data files obtained for the **META-TASK**, you will receive $40$ points for each *distinct* and correct password.

If you report a password that does not exist on the Chert And site, your score will be **zero**.

# Output

The first line of your submission will contain $K$ ($K \le 5$), the number of passwords reported by you. The next line should contain the passwords.

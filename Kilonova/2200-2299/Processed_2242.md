Sebi wanted to create a program that adds two numbers to help him solve math problems. In the implementation, he wanted to use subprograms (or functions).

# Task

He noticed that the program does not work correctly. Help Sebi solve the problem so he can continue his math homework. You can find his program [here](numsum.cpp) or in the "Attachments" section on the side.

# Input data

The keyboard contains two natural numbers $m$ and $n$.

# Output data

The screen contains the sum of the numbers $m$ and $n$.

# Constraints and clarifications

- $0 \le m, n \le 10^9$

# Example

`stdin`
```
5 7
```

`stdout`
```
12
```

## Explanation

$5 + 7 = 12$

It appears that there was an attempt to reference a file that doesn't exist or isn't accessible. Without the content of the "statement-ro.md" file, I cannot directly translate the problem statement as requested.

If you provide the actual content of the Romanian problem statement or copy the text here, I'll be more than happy to help translate it according to the specified instructions.

# Task

Given a natural number $n$, with at most $4$ digits. Implement the function duplicare, which takes the number $n$ as a parameter and returns $d$, the number obtained by duplicating each odd digit of the number $n$, or $-1$ if no digit was duplicated.

The proposed solution should only contain the definition of the required subprogram. The presence of other instructions in the solution may lead to compilation or execution errors, which will result in a penalty.

# Example

For example, duplicare($1032$) = $110332$, but duplicare($4084$) = $-1$.
```

The file contents you provided indicate that the attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 431. Unfortunately, without the actual content of the competitive programming problem statement written in Romanian, I am unable to perform the translation and transformation as requested.

If you can provide the Romanian text of the problem statement, I'd be happy to assist with the translation and formatting. Here's an example of how you can present the text:

```
# Problem Name

## Cerință
[Insert problem description here with MathJax expressions]

## Date de intrare
[Insert input format description]

## Date de ieșire
[Insert output format description]

## Exemple
### Intrare
[Example input]
### Iesire
[Example output]

## Restricții și precizări
[Insert constraints and clarifications]

~[image.png|attribute1=value1|attribute2=value2]
```

Please provide the specific text, and I'll get to work on translating it for you.

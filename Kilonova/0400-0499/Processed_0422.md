Here is the translated and processed competitive programming problem statement:

```
Mitruț has the first `N` natural nonzero numbers and a rooted tree with `N` nodes. He wonders in how many ways he can place the `N` numbers in the nodes of the tree so that each node contains a number smaller than all the numbers in its children.

# Task

Write a program to answer Mitruț's question by displaying the number of distinct ways of placing the numbers in the tree according to the method above, modulo `666013`.

# Input data

The file `arbore.in` contains:
- The first line contains the number `N` with the meaning from the statement.
- The following `N - 1` lines each contain two integers `x` and `y`, signifying that there is an edge between nodes `x` and `y`.

# Output data

The file `arbore.out` will contain a single number representing the answer to Mitruț's question, modulo `666013`.

# Constraints and clarifications

* `1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000`
* For `70%` of the tests `N \leq 2\ 000`
* The root of the tree is node `1`
* For `10%` of the tests `N \leq 7`
* The given tree is not necessarily binary (a node can have more than two children)

# Example

`arbore.in`
```
5
1 2
3 1
2 4
2 5
```
`arbore.out`
```
8
```

I have translated the problem statement while keeping the mathematical values, variable names, general syntax, structure, and format same. I have also preserved your custom image format exactly as is. Additionally, I have checked for and fixed any potential grammar and syntax errors.

Multiple car brands (written in different manners) are read from the file `test.in`. Store them in memory and display each brand a single time in a standard manner in the file `test.out`. The brands should be output in the order they appear in the input file.
**Attention!** In the competition, the output was displayed in the console. Here, the output should be written to the file `test.out`.

Hint: Use the function `standard_string()` to store the correct format!

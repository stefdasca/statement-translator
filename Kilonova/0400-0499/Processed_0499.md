The Galactic Empire had to abandon the well-known spacecraft due to increasingly strict pollution regulations. The administration is now required to develop a network of transplanetary tunnels through which inhabitants will travel.
The Empire consists of $N$ planets, represented as points in space. The cost of forming a transplanetary tunnel between two planets $A$ and $B$ is:
$TunnelCost[A, B] = min(|x_A - x_B|, |y_A - y_B|, |z_A - z_B|)$, where $(x_A, y_A, z_A)$ are the 3D coordinates of planet $A$ and $(x_B, y_B, z_B)$ are the 3D coordinates of planet $B$. 

# Task

The Empire has to build exactly $N-1$ tunnels to completely connect all the planets. Due to rebels, the Galactic Empireâ€™s administration no longer has as much money as it used to and needs to use it as efficiently as possible. Find the smallest possible cost to successfully complete this project.
\
**Note:** The planets occupy distinct positions in space.

# Input data

The input contains the natural number $N$, the number of planets, on the first line.
The next $N$ lines each contain a triplet of integer values $x_k \\ y_k \\ z_k$, representing the coordinates of the planets.

# Output data

Print the minimum cost of the tunnel network on the first line.

# Constraints and clarifications

- $ 1 \\le N \\le 10^5$.
- $ -10^9 \\le x_k, y_k, z_k \\le 10^9$.
- For tests worth 50 points, $N \\le 1000$.

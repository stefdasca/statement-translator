Researchers from the LHC (**Large Hadron Collider**) project in Geneva have announced the discovery of a new form of matter: **flatquarkon**. This is characterized by a two-dimensional structure made up of quarks (elementary particles from the standard model) held together by the strong nuclear force - similar to solids that gain their properties due to chemical bonds between constituent atoms. Each quark possesses a property called effective mass (hereafter referred to as mass), which includes both its own mass and the effects produced by interacting with other quarks. We can represent the mass of the entire system by a matrix with $N$ rows and $M$ columns:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\begin{bmatrix}
m_{11} & m_{12} & ...\\
m_{21} & m_{22} & ... \\
...  & ... & ...
\end{bmatrix}
(MeV/c^2)
\end{gather*}
$$

where $m_{ij}$ represents the mass of the quark located at row $i$ and column $j$.

By applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of a flatquarkon, we can energetically activate one or more quarks, making them capable of participating in nuclear reactions. If two active quarks are adjacent (neighbors on a row or column), they will participate together in any nuclear reaction.

# Task

Consider a flatquarkon in a magnet-free environment.
A list of $Q$ instructions of two types is given:

- type $1$: Apply a magnetic field to the quark at row $i$ and column $j$. If the quark is inactive, it will be activated by the magnetic field. If it is already active, nothing will happen;
- type $2$: Find the maximum energy released in a nuclear reaction between two active zones of the flatquarkon. An active zone is a connected subarray of the matrix (all included quarks are adjacent) that contains only active quarks and has maximum size (no other active quark can be added without violating the connectivity property). Recall the famous formula for mass-energy equivalence, $E=mc^2$. Thus, the energy released in a nuclear reaction is equal to the sum of the masses of all quarks from both zones (in $MeV$).

# Input data

The input data contains on the first line $2$ integers $N$ and $M$, separated by a space, representing the dimensions of the mass matrix.
The next $N$ lines contain $M$ integers each, separated by spaces, representing the mass matrix description.
The next line contains the integer $Q$, representing the number of instructions. The next $Q$ lines contain an integer $t$, or $3$ integers separated by spaces $t$, $i$, and $j$. If $t=1$, a magnetic field is applied to the quark at row $i$ and column $j$. If $t=2$, print the maximum energy released in a nuclear reaction using the current configuration of the flatquarkon. If a reaction is impossible, print $-1$.

# Output data

Print the answer for all type $2$ instructions, each on a separate line.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N*M \leq 4*10^5$;
* $1 \leq Q \leq 2*10^5$;
* $1 \leq m_{ij} \leq 1 \ 000$;
* A zone cannot react with itself;
* Subtask $1$ ($20$p): $N=M$ and $Q \leq 2 \ 000$;
* Subtask $2$ ($20$p): $Q \leq 2 \ 000$;
* Subtask $3$ ($20$p): $N=1$;
* Subtask $4$ ($40$p): No additional constraints.

## Explanation

- In the first type $2$ instruction, there are no active zones, hence a reaction is impossible.
- In the second type $2$ instruction, we have two active zones $[1, 1]$ and $[2, 2]$. The energy released is $1 + 5 = 6 \; MeV$.
- In the third type $2$ instruction, we have a single active zone $[[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2]]$, making a reaction impossible.
- In the fourth type $2$ instruction, we have two active zones $[[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2]]$ and $[1, 3]$. The energy released is $1 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 13 \; MeV$.

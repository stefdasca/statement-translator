To prepare for the local phase of the AcadNet olympiad, Octavian is searching for various bugs on dubious websites. In a "Spot the bug challenge" contest, he comes across the following code, but he has no idea how to solve it.

\

The initial problem involves displaying even numbers between $0$ and $n$ inclusive ($1 \leq n \leq 100$), adhering to the constraints mentioned in the code. After several hours of unsuccessful attempts, Octavian asks for your help with this challenge.

# Task
[Here](classic.cpp) (or in the "Attachments" section on the side), you will find the complete program that contains bugs. You can consider that the `main()` function is written correctly and does not contain any bugs. Your task is to fix the `check_if_stop()` function.
**Attention!** The source you will submit for this problem will contain only the definition of this function (without the `main()` function, without includes, etc.).

# Example
`stdin`
```
4
```

`stdout`
```
0
2

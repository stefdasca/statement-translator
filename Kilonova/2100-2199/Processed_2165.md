It seems the file you mentioned, 'statement-ro.md', does not exist or cannot be found. Without the specific content of the competitive programming problem statement in Romanian, I'm unable to perform the translation and content processing as requested.

If you can provide the text of the problem statement directly here, I'd be happy to process it accordingly.

Given a matrix of size $N$ by $N$ containing letters of the English alphabet. We define a right-down path as a sequence of cells in the matrix that starts at cell $(1, 1)$, ends at cell $(N, N)$, and for each cell $(x, y)$ in the path (except the last one), its successor is either $(x+1, y)$ or $(x, y+1)$. We say that the string generated by a path in the matrix is the string obtained by concatenating the values of the path's cells in order.

# Task

Find 2 right-down paths that do not intersect (except at cells $(1, 1)$ and $(N, N)$) for which the similarity coefficient is maximized. The similarity coefficient of 2 paths represents the number of positions $i$ for which $a_i = b_i$, $0 \leq i < |a|$, where $a$ and $b$ are the strings generated by the 2 paths.

# Input data

The first line contains the value $N$. The next $N$ lines contain $N$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet, representing the matrix.

# Output data

The first line will contain the maximum similarity coefficient between 2 right-down paths that only intersect at the endpoints.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N \leq 300$
* For tests worth $20$ points, $1 \leq N \leq 7$.
* For tests worth $50$ points, $1 \leq N \leq 50$.
* For tests worth $80$ points, $1 \leq N \leq 150$.

## Explanation

The paths are:
* `abefq`: $(1, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3, 3)$
* `acefq`: $(1, 1) \rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (3, 2) \rightarrow (3, 3)$

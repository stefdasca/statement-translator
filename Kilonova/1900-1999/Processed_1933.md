Two undirected trees with $N$ nodes labeled from $1$ to $N$ and edge costs are given. The first tree is named **TREN**, and the second is named **BUS**. For two nodes $A$ and $B$ and a tree $T$, we define $d(A, B, T)$ as the maximum value of an edge on the elementary path between nodes $A$ and $B$ in tree $T$. We are interested in pairs of values $X$ and $Y$ such that $d(X, Y, TREN) + d(X, Y, BUS)$ is as small as possible. Depending on the value of a parameter $C$ from the input data, you should print the required minimum sum, respectively the number of value pairs $(X, Y)$ that achieve this minimum value.

# Input data

The first line of the input file `trenbus.in` contains the natural numbers $C$ and $N$.\
The next $N-1$ lines contain the undirected edges that describe the **TREN** tree, and the next $N-1$ lines contain the undirected edges that describe the **BUS** tree. Each edge is described by $3$ natural numbers $a \\ b \\ c$, representing the endpoints of the edge and the cost.

# Output data

The only line of the output file `trenbus.out` will contain:
- if $C=1$, only the required sum,
- if $C=2$, the required sum and the number of pairs separated by a space.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N \leq 100 \ 000$
* $1 \leq C \leq 2$
* $1 \leq c \leq 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000$
* For tests worth $5$ points, $C=1$ and $N \leq 100$
* For other tests worth $25$ points, $C=1$ and $N \leq 50 \ 000$
* For other tests worth $25$ points, $C=1$ and $N \leq 100 \ 000$
* For other tests worth $20$ points, $C=2$ and $N \leq 50 \ 000$
* For other tests worth $25$ points, $C=2$ and $N \leq 100 \ 000$

# Example 1

`trenbus.in`
```
1 3
1 2 5
2 3 6
1 3 1
2 3 2
```

`trenbus.out`
```
7
```

## Explanation

$C=1$, only the minimum sum is printed. Generated by $x = 1$, $y = 2$ or $x = 1$, $y = 3$.

# Example 2

`trenbus.in`
```
2 5
1 2 2
2 5 3
2 4 7
2 3 2
1 2 4
2 3 4
3 4 3
4 5 2
```

`trenbus.out`
```
6 4
```

## Explanation

$C=2$; The minimum sum is $6$, and the number of node pairs generating this minimum sum is $4$.

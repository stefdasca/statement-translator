It appears that the document you're referring to doesn't exist or I don't have access to it. Let's address this issue:

1. **Confirm the existence and correctness of the file path**: Please ensure you're referencing the correct file path and that the file indeed exists.

2. **Provide the content directly**: You can copy and paste the content of the markdown file here, and I can help you translate it manually.

Could you provide the content of the `statement-ro.md` file? This way, I can proceed with the translation task as requested.

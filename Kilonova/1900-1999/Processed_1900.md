It looks like the file `statement-ro.md` does not exist for Problem ID 1900, according to the provided content: `b"\xef\xbb\xbfAttachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 1900.\n"`.

Since the competitive programming problem statement in Romanian is not available, I cannot proceed with the translation task based on the given instructions.

If you provide the actual content of the problem statement in Romanian, I'd be more than happy to help with the translation!

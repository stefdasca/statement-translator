It seems there might be an issue with the file you mentioned, given the content you shared: 

```b"\xef\xbb\xbfAttachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 1941.\n"```

This indicates that the file `'statement-ro.md'` does not exist for Problem ID 1941. Without the content of the markdown file in the Romanian language containing the problem statement, I cannot proceed with the translation.

Could you please ensure the file exists or provide the actual content of the problem statement so I can assist you further in translating it?

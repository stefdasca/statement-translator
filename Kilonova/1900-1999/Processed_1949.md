Here's the translated statement with corrections based on your instructions:

This problem is interactive. The committee has a positive value on $16$ bits, unknown to you. This value will be modified according to the following rules.
1. You will successively send positive values on $16$ bits using a function provided by the committee. 
2. The committee will perform the bitwise XOR operation between the value you provide and that unknown value. 
3. On the bits of the obtained value, the committee will apply a circular rotation of the bits by a random number between $0$ and $15$ positions (a rotation by $x$ positions means moving the sequence formed by the last $x$ bits from the last $x$ positions to the first $x$ positions). 

Thus, the new unknown value will be obtained instead of the old value. These rules will be applied at most $100 \ 000$ times. If after a number of applications of the rule, the unknown value becomes $0$, you are considered magical and you gain points (very important in the future). If not, you gain nothing.

Your program must contain a function:
```cpp 
void play()
```
This function must call the function:
```cpp
int giveValue (int x)
```
at most $100 \ 000$ times. The value of the parameter $x$ must be exactly the value you wish to transmit. The `giveValue` function is provided to you by the committee and will return $1$ if you guessed the number, $0$ otherwise.

# Constraints and clarifications
* The `play` function will be called at most $100$ times within a test.
* Do not call the `giveValue` function more than $100 \ 000$ times in the implementation of the `play` function.
* The number provided in the `giveValue` function must be in the range $[0,2^{16})$.
* You do not need to implement the `main` function.
* You must include the file `"magic.h"`.

# Example

Grader: `play()`
Contestant: `giveValue(1)`
Contestant: `giveValue(2)`
Contestant: `giveValue(16)`
Grader: Award points!

## Explanation

The secret value is $7=0000000000000111$.

The value becomes $7 \oplus 1=6=0000000000000110$.
The value becomes $3=0000000000000011$ after a rotation by one position.

The value becomes $3 \oplus 2=1=0000000000000001$.
The value becomes $16=0000000000010000$ after a rotation by $12$ positions.

The value becomes $16 \oplus 16=0=0000000000000000$.
The value becomes $0=0000000000000000$ after a rotation by $9$ positions.

The unknown value was transformed into $0$ after $3$ calls!

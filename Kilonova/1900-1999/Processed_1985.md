It appears that the text you provided is referring to an attachment named `'statement-ro.md'` for Problem ID 1985, but it seems that the file does not exist. This means that I don't have access to the specific competitive programming problem statement that you wanted to translate.

To proceed with the task, please provide the content of the Romanian problem statement directly in this chat, and I will follow the instructions to translate it into English while preserving the specified structure and format.

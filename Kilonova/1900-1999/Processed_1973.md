Here is the translation of the provided competitive programming problem statement:

---

Two sequences $A$ and $B$ of lengths $N$ and $M$ with natural numbers less than or equal to $K$. An entanglement of the two sequences is a matrix $C$ of dimensions $N \cdot M$ where for all pairs $(i, j)$ the value $C_{ij}$ is equal to either $A_i$ or $B_j$. 

Given a matrix $C$, how many pairs of sequences $(A, B)$ exist for which $C$ is an entanglement of the two sequences?

# Task

Write a program that, for given $N$, $M$, $K$ and matrix $C$, determines:

* if the matrix $C$ can be an entanglement of two sequences;
* the number of pairs of sequences $(A, B)$ for which the matrix $C$ represents an entanglement.

# Input data

The input file `entanglement.in` contains on the first line the numbers $T$, $N$, $M$ and $K$, and on the next $N$ lines, $M$ natural numbers each representing the elements in matrix $C$.
If $T=1$ then it will determine if the matrix $C$ can be an entanglement, and if $T=2$ then it will determine the number of pairs of sequences $(A, B)$ for which $C$ represents an entanglement.

# Output data

If $T=1$, the output file `entanglement.out` will contain the word “DA” if $C$ can be an entanglement or the word “NU” otherwise.
If $T=2`, the output file `entanglement.out` will contain a single number representing the remainder modulo $1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 007$ of the number of pairs of sequences for which the matrix $C$ represents an entanglement.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N, M \leq 300$
* $1 \leq K \leq N \cdot M$
* For tests worth $32$ points $T = 1$.
* For tests worth $32$ points $T = 2$ and $N, M \leq 60$.
* For the remaining tests, worth $36$ points, $T = 2$.

# Example 1

`entanglement.in`
```
1 2 2 2
1 1
1 2
```

`entanglement.out`
```
DA
```

## Explanation

One possible solution is $A$ = {$1, 1$} and $B$ = {$1, 2$}.

# Example 2

`entanglement.in`
```
2 2 2 2
1 1
1 2
```

`entanglement.out`
```
5
```

## Explanation

The $5$ solutions are:
$(A = \{1, 1\}, B = \{1, 2\})$  
$(A = \{1, 1\}, B = \{2, 2\})$  
$(A = \{1, 2\}, B = \{1, 1\})$  
$(A = \{2, 2\}, B = \{1, 1\})$  
$(A = \{1, 2\}, B = \{1, 2\})$

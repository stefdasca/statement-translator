# Task

You are given a number with $N$ digits from which you must remove exactly $K$ digits. Calculate the maximum number that can be obtained.

# Input data

The first line of the input file `numar-maxim.in` will contain $2$ numbers $N$ and $K$. The second line will contain a natural number with $N$ digits.

# Output data

The first line of the output file `numar-maxim.out` will contain a single number, the maximum number that can be obtained while respecting the conditions from the task.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $K < N \leq 500\ 000$;
* For tests worth 50 points $K < N \leq 1\ 000$;

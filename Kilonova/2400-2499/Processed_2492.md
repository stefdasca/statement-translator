Alan Wake, the writer, has gotten lost in his own mind palace. This palace is like a labyrinth that has an exit. There are zones in the labyrinth that are blocked. Fortunately, he has a lamp with him that allows him to teleport to the dark dimension, which is also a labyrinth. Alan can jump from one dimension to another, keeping his position, but the lamp is running out of power and has a limited number of uses.

The two labyrinths are represented by matrices of $0$ and $1$. Wake can move one position in the labyrinth, in 4 directions: north, south, east, west. He cannot move diagonally. He can also jump between the two dimensions, keeping his position. The switch can happen only if in both dimensions, the square where teleportation occurs is free. In the labyrinth coding, $0$ means free and $1$ means wall.

# Task

Alan Wake wants to find the shortest path in the labyrinth and uncover the truth.

He tried to write a C++ program to fulfill this desire, but it contains some bugs and he cannot identify them. Correct Alan Wake's program. You can find it [here](alanwake.cpp) or in the "Attachments" section on the sidebar.

## Hint

For the labyrinth problem, usually, Lee's algorithm (Breadth-First Search) is used, which uses a queue as a data structure. However, in our problem, we have two labyrinths (one of light and one of darkness), and teleportation is limited.

The solution is to represent the space as a 3D matrix, where the first layer is the light labyrinth, the second is the dark labyrinth, the third is again the light labyrinth, alternating likewise. The depth of the 3D matrix is the maximum number of switches plus $1$. The depth value represents the number of teleportations used. In addition to the 4 movements on one layer, we add a new move, namely, going one layer lower, at the same position, representing teleportation. The character can go down but cannot ascend.

Thus, we simulate the transition between dimensions by crossing layers. If Wake is on the first layer, it means he has used $0$ teleportations. If he is on the last, it means he has used all of them and cannot move further in depth.

For example, the following movements between two labyrinths:

~[example1.png]

In the 3D space, the same movements look like this:

~[example2.png]

# Input data

The first line contains $switch\\_max$ — the maximum number of teleportations that Wake can perform.

The second line contains $n$ and $m$ — the number of rows and columns of the labyrinth.

An empty line follows, after which the light labyrinth is read — $n$ lines with $m$ numbers each.

Another empty line follows, after which the dark labyrinth is read — $n$ lines with $m$ numbers each.

An empty line is left. The next line contains $start_x$ and $start_y$ — the row and column where Wake is located in the light labyrinth, indexed from $0$. The next line contains $target_x$ and $target_y$ — the row and column where Wake needs to reach in the light labyrinth, indexed from $0$.

# Output data

Print on the screen the length of the shortest path, including teleportations.

If it is not possible to reach the end or there are not enough teleportations, print `-1`.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $3 \leq n, m \leq 50$
* $0 \leq switch\\_max \leq 15$
* The matrices are guaranteed to be bordered at the edges with $1$.
* The starting and ending positions are free zones in the light labyrinth.

## Explanation

Alan makes $7$ moves down to reach the end. Furthermore, to bypass the walls, he makes $4$ teleportations:
* from light to dark, coordinates $(1, 1)$;
* from dark to light, coordinates $(3, 1)$;
* from light to dark, coordinates $(5, 1)$;
* from dark to light, coordinates $(7, 1)$.

In total (including teleportations), there are $7 + 4 = 11$ moves.

## Explanation

Same as in Example $1$, but there are not enough teleportations, and there is no way to get from the start to the finish.

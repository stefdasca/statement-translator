# Task
You have at your disposal a C++ program ([here](interclasare.cpp) or in the "Attachments" section on the side) that reads two sorted arrays and displays the resulting merged array. Correct this program.

# Input data
The keyboard input contains $n$ and $m$, the lengths of the two arrays. The following 2 lines contain the $n$ and $m$ elements of the arrays, respectively.

# Output data
The screen output contains the merged array.

# Constraints and clarifications
- $1 \le n, m \le 100$
- The elements of the arrays are integers in the range $[1, 10\ 000]$.

# Example
`stdin`
```
3 5
1 2 3
2 6 7 8 9
```
`stdout`
```
1 2 2 3 6 7 8 9
```

Sure, here is the translated competitive programming problem statement in English:

---

Consider a binary sequence, $S$, of length $N$ and indexed from $0$. On this sequence, we can perform the following operation any number of times:

* Choose a position $i$ ($0 \leq i < N - 1)$ with the property that $S_{i}=S_{i+1}$ and remove the elements $S_{i}$ and $S_{i+1}$ from the sequence.

After this operation, the sequence becomes $S_{0}\dots S_{i-1}S_{i+2}\dots S_{N-1}$.

# Task

Now, Conte the Swedish wants to know how many binary sequences of length $N$ can become empty after applying the above operation on them any number of times. Since this number can be very large, you are asked to return its remainder when divided by $10^9 + 9$.

# Input data

The single line will contain the number $N$.

# Output data

Print a single number, representing the remainder when divided by $10^9 + 9$ of the number of binary sequences that can become empty by applying the above operation on them any number of times.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$
* This problem was also given in Prosoft@NT 2024 â€” there, the subtasks were rewarded with $7$, $25$, $41$ and $27$ points.

| # | Points | Constraints | 
| - | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | 3      | $1 \leq N \leq 6$ |
| 2 | 11     | $1 \leq N \leq 16$ |
| 3 | 38     | $1 \leq N \leq 1\ 000$ |
| 4 | 48     | No additional constraints. | 

# Example

`stdin`
```
4
```

`stdout`
```
6
```

## Explanation

The $6$ sequences are $1111$, $0000$, $1100$, $0011$, $0110$, $1001$.

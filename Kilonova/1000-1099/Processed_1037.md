Two integers $a$ and $b$ are given. Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

# Input data

In `stdin` contain two integers, $a$ and $b$.

# Output data

The first line from `stdout` will contain a single integer, the sum of the two numbers.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $-10^{18} \leq a, b \leq 10^{18}$

# Example 1

`stdin`
```
1
2
```

`stdout`
```
3
```

## Explanation

As can be seen, $1 + 2 = 3$.

# Example 2

`stdin`
```
5
-1
```

`stdout`
```
4
```

## Explanation

$5 + (-1) = 4$, as we know.

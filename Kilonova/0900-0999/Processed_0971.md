It seems like there was an issue with accessing the content of the file 'statement-ro.md'. Without the actual content of the problem statement in Romanian, it isn't possible to perform the translation as you've requested.

If you provide the text of the competitive programming problem statement, I'd be more than happy to translate it according to the specified instructions.

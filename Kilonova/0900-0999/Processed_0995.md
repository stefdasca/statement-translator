It seems the content provided is an error message about a missing file, specifically 'statement-ro.md' for Problem ID 995. Therefore, there isn't a competitive programming problem statement to translate. 

Could you please provide the text of the competitive programming problem statement written in Romanian so I can proceed with the translation as requested?

It looks like the problem statement file `statement-ro.md` does not exist for Problem ID 978. Because of this, I'm unable to access and translate the content based on your instructions.

To assist you further, could you please provide the text of the competitive programming problem statement you'd like me to translate? This way, I can ensure that the translation meets your requirements accurately.

It appears there was an indication regarding an attachment that does not exist, specifically `statement-ro.md`. Without the actual content of the problem statement, I am unable to provide a translation. 

If you can provide the details or content of the competitive programming problem statement in Romanian, I would be happy to assist with translating it according to the specified instructions.

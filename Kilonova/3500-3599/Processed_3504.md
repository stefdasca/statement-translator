# Task
It seems that this year as well, Sebi needs help with his math homework. Since he already has a good grasp of addition, he decided to move on to multiplication, but since he hasn't yet learned to code correctly, the program he built to assist him with the product of three numbers isn't working. He is asking you once again to help him complete his math homework. You can find his program [here](bad_source.cpp) or in the â€œAttachmentsâ€ section on the side.

# Input data
The numbers $a$, $b$, $c$ are read from the keyboard, separated by spaces.

# Output data
Print on the screen the result of multiplying the three numbers.

# Constraints and clarifications
* $1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1 \ 000$

# Example
`stdin`
```
1 2 3
```
`stdout`
```
6
```
## Explanation
$1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6$

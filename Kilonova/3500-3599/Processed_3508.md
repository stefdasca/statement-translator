# Task
In the city of Acadne»ôti, a group of criminals has marked the houses they plan to break into. After extensive investigations, the police chief, Cpplena, found $n$ marked houses, and only those with an even number are actually planned to be broken into (those with an odd number were marked to mislead). To ease the work, a program was built, but it seems it doesn't work. Therefore, she sought your help to fix it and complete her investigation. You can find the program [here](bad_source.cpp) or in the "Attachments" section on the side.

# Input data

A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Thus, in the interval [$1, 30$] the prime numbers are: $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, $11$, $13$, $17$, $19$, $23$, $29$, a total of $10$ prime numbers.

Note: The number $1$ is not considered a prime number!

# Task:

Given two numbers $n$, $k$ determine $2 \cdot k$ prime numbers located in the center of the list of prime numbers in the interval [$1, n$], if the interval contains an even number of prime numbers, and $2 \cdot k-1$ numbers from the center of the list of prime numbers, if the number of prime numbers is odd.

If the number $2 \cdot k$ (or $2 \cdot k-1$) is greater than the number of prime numbers in the considered interval, then all prime numbers from the interval will be displayed.

# Input data

The first line of the input file `prim.in` will contain two numbers $n$ and $k$, with the meaning: $n$ = the upper bound of the interval from which the prime numbers are determined; $k$ = has the meaning from the statement.

# Output data

The first line of the output file `prim.out` will contain the requested $2 \cdot k$ or $2 \cdot k-1$ numbers, separated by space.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq n \leq 10\ 000$;
* $1 \leq k \leq 30$;
* $1 \leq k \leq n$;

Here is the translated statement with the required specifications and corrections:

--

To compete with the serial number of Intel Pentium III processors, Advanced Micro Devices established an identification system for its new processors with the codename Thunderbird. Each distributing company receives a set of letters (for example: {a, m, x}) from which they have to form their own identification codes. Companies are required to include each letter exactly as many times as specified in these codes. For example, a company must form identifiers that contain exactly $3$ letters a, $2$ letters m, and $1$ letter x.

# Task

Write a program that, given a certain code, determines the next valid code in lexicographic order, if such a next code exists.

# Input data

The input file `cod.in` contains one line with a code, given as a string of characters $s$.

# Output data

The output file `cod.out` will contain the next code. If such a code does not exist, the file will contain ‘Este ultimul cod.’

# Constraints and clarifications

* Codes are composed of at most $100$ lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet.

# Example 1

`cod.in`
```
amaaxm
```

`cod.out`
```
amamax
```

# Example 2

`cod.in`
```
xmmaaa
```

`cod.out`
```
Este ultimul cod.
```

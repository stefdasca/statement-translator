# Task

Identify all the **dispensable** discs in the figure.

# Input data

From the input file `discuri.in`, the first line will contain the number $N$ of discs, and the next $N$ lines will contain $N$ real numbers representing the radii of the discs in the given order, one per line.

# Output data

In the output file `discuri.out`, the first line should contain the number $K$ of dispensable discs, and the next $K$ lines should contain $K$ integers representing the indices of the discs considered, one per line.

# Constraints and clarifications

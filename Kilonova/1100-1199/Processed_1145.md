Be the sequence of all natural numbers from $1$ to a certain number $N$. Considering that each number is associated with a sign ($+$ or $-$) and summing all these signed numbers, we obtain a sum $S$.

The problem consists in determining, for a given sum $S$, the minimum number $N$ for which, by associating signs to all numbers from $1$ to $N$, the sum $S$ can be obtained.

# Task

For a given $S$, find the minimum value $N$ and the association of signs to the numbers from $1$ to $N$ to obtain $S$ under the given conditions.

# Input data

In the file `suma.in`, the first line contains a positive integer $S$ representing the sum that needs to be obtained.

# Output data

In the file `suma.out`, the first line will contain the minimum number $N$ for which the sum $S$ can be obtained. The following lines, up to the end of the file, will contain the numbers which have a negative sign, one per line. The order of the numbers does not matter.

The other numbers which do not appear in the file are considered positive. If there are multiple solutions, only one is required.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $0 < S \leq 100\ 000$

# Example

`suma.in`
```
12
```

`suma.out`
```
7
1
7
```

# Explanation

Thus, the sum $12$ can be obtained from a minimum of $7$ terms as follows: $12 = -1 +2+3+4+5+6 -7$. Note: this is not the only possible way of associating signs to the terms from $1$ to $7$.

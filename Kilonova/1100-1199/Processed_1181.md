The text represents a competitive programming problem. Below is the translated problem statement in English:

---
A war zone is approximated in the shape of a circle on whose circumference $N$ points representing allied troop headquarters are established, with the property that no three chords with endpoints at these $N$ points are concurrent at a point located inside the circle. Between any two points (headquarters), there is a safe direct access route. These routes, together with the circumference of the circle, delimit a number of distinct regions. There is information that the regions thus delimited actually represent mined fields by enemy combatants. Each such region will be thoroughly examined by an allied soldier properly equipped with mine detectors.

# Task

Indicate the number of soldiers needed to inspect all the formed regions.

# Input data

The input file `asediu.in` contains on the first and only line $N$, the number of headquarters.

# Output data

The output file `asediu.out` contains on the first line the number $T$ of soldiers needed to inspect all the formed regions.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $2 \leq N \leq 2 \ 000 \ 000$

# Example

`asediu.in`
```
5
```

`asediu.out`
```
16
```

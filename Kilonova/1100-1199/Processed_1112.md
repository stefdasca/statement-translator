It seems that there isn't an actual competitive programming problem statement provided in Romanian. Instead, the content mentions that "Attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 1112."

Given this situation, there's no specific text to translate. If you can provide the actual Romanian problem statement, I'd be happy to help with the translation!

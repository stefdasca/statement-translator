Let's imagine a network composed of nodes located at integer coordinate points, each node being connected to 4 neighboring nodes by bars parallel to the coordinate axes. A spider is initially placed at the origin of the coordinate system. Each second, the spider can move from the node where it is to one of the 4 neighboring nodes.

# Task

Write a program to determine in how many ways the spider can move from the initial position to a given final position in the shortest possible time.

# Input data

The input file `spider.in` contains on a single line the abscissa and ordinate of the final point, separated by space: $x\ y$.

# Output data

The output file `spider.out` will contain on the first line the number of determined ways $Nr$.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $0 \leq x,\ y \leq 80$;
* For tests worth $40$ points, $0 \leq x,\ y \leq 20$;

# Example 1

`spider.in`
```
1 2
```

`spider.out`
```
3
```

# Example 2

`spider.in`
```
2 3
```

`spider.out`
```
10
```

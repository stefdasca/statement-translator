Gigel enjoys building increasing sequences of numbers from the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots ,n \}$. At one point, he notices that some sequences, with at least $k$ terms ($3 \leq k$), have a special property: the difference between two consecutive terms is constant.

Here are some examples of such sequences for $22 \leq n$:

$2, 3, 4$

$1, 5, 9, 13$

$7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22$

# Task

Given the natural number $n$, help Gigel count how many such sequences he can construct.

# Input data

In the input file `sir.in` contains, on the first line, the number $n$.

# Output data

The output file `sir.out` will contain, on the first line, the required number followed by a newline character.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $3 \leq n \leq 20\ 000$
* $3 \leq k \leq n$

# Example 1

`sir.in`

`sir.out`

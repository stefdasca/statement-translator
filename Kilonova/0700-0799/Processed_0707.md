Consider the following sequence, constructed such that each element, except for the first one, is obtained from the preceding one: $1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, \dots$
The terms of the sequence are numbered starting from $1$.

# Task

Given $n$, a natural number, determine the $n$-th term in the given sequence.

# Input data

The input file `sir.in` contains on the first line the number $n$.

# Output data

The output file `sir.out` will contain on the first line a single integer, the $n$-th term of the sequence.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $4 \leq n \leq 35$;
* the number of digits of a term does not exceed $17\ 000$.

# Example 1

`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
1211
```

# Example 2

`sir.in`
```
5
```

`sir.out`
```
111221
```

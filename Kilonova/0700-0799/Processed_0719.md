Copa arrived in Orintia where there is a temple with several levels, the base being a square with side length $L$. The first level has a height equal to $N$, and the other levels are one unit higher than the previous one. For example, for $L = 5$ and $N = 3$, from the rock rises the temple (view from the plane and from the ground):

Copa opened an old document and read: â€œTo find out how much gold is in the temple, you need to sum the number of meters on each horizontalâ€¦â€ And Copa calculated: $3+3+3+3+3=15$; $3+4+4+4+3=18$; $3+4+5+4+3=19$; the others $18$ and $15$. â€œThen, you need to find the sum of the obtained numbersâ€¦â€ And Copa noted the number $85$. â€œAll obtained numbers stick together to form the smallest possible numberâ€¦â€ And Copa obtained the number: $151518181985$. â€œFrom this number you seek the largest two-digit number of adjacent digits. This is the amount of gold in the temple.â€ And Copa screamed with joy: $98$!.

# Task

Head to Orintia! You will be given the two numbers $N$ and $L$ and you are asked to determine the obtained number from sums and the amount of gold.

# Input data

The file `templu.in` contains on the first line the numbers $N$ and $L$ separated by a space.

# Output data

The file `templu.out` will contain two lines. Each line will contain a number. The first line will contain the obtained number from sums, and the second line will contain the amount of gold.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $2 \leq L \leq 10$;
* $1 \leq N \leq 50$;

# Example

`templu.out`

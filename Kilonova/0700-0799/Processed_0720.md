A rectangular cake of dimensions $M \cdot N$ must be divided into square portions of the same size.

# Task

Find the minimum number of portions that can be obtained and their size $L$. Both the dimensions of the rectangle and the squares into which it is divided are integers.

# Input data

The file `tort.in` will contain on the first line the numbers $M$ and $N$ separated by a space. 

# Output data

The file `tort.out` will contain on a single line two natural numbers separated by a space, the first being the minimum number of portions, and the second being the size $L$.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq M, N \leq 10\ 000$;

# Example

`tort.in`
```

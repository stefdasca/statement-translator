Let's consider the following sequence:

`a`, `b`, `ba`, `bab`, `babba`, `babbabab`, ...

# Task

Write a program that determines the $n$-th term of the sequence

# Input data

The input file `sir.in` contains a single line that contains the natural number $n$.

# Output data

The output file `sir.out` will contain a single line that contains the $n$-th term of the sequence.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq n \leq 20$;

# Example

`sir.in`
```
4
```

`sir.out`
```
bab
```

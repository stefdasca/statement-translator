In how many ways modulo `1 000 000 007` can a chessboard with `N` rows and `M` columns (`N`x`M`) be colored using `K` colors such that any two adjacent squares have different colors?

# Constraints and clarifications
* `1 \leq N * M \leq 90`
* `2 \leq K \leq 1 000 000`
* For `75` points `N * M \leq 80`

# Example
`stdin`
```
2 3 4
```

`stdout`
```
588
```

`stdin`
```
7 5 182931
```

`stdout`
```
35823641
```

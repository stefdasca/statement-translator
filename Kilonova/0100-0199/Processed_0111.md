The name of a magic square of order `N` is a matrix with `3` rows and `3` columns with non-negative integer elements (greater than or equal to `0`) having the property that the sum of the elements of any row and any column is `N`.

# Task
Write a program that determines the number of magic squares of order `N` modulo `30103`.

# Input data
The input file `patrat.in` contains on the first line the number `N`.

# Output data
The output file `patrat.out` will contain the number of magic squares of order `N` modulo `30103`.

# Constraints and clarifications
* `1 \leq N \leq 1\ 000\ 000`

# Examples

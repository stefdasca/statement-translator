# "Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before."

Jean-Luc Picard – the captain of the Enterprise sets the new destination: the Romulan Star Empire. The wormhole newly discovered by the crew ensures the passage to the Beta Quadrant – the galactic area where the Romulan Star Empire is located.

Hypothetically, we can view the wormhole as a line segment partitioned into `N` sectors of equal lengths numbered from `1` to `N` which the ship will traverse in this exact order. Depending on the spacetime distortions encountered, the ship can traverse at least `p` sectors and at most `q` sectors in one sidereal year (UTC – *coordinated universal time*). For each sector, Captain Picard must inform the Federation about the year in which it was traversed. Due to interferences, data transmission is deficient. Thus, the Federation does not receive information from all `N` sectors.

# Task
Knowing the description of `M` transmissions received by the Federation in the form: `s t`, where `s` represents the index of a sector, and `t` represents the year in which it is traversed, determine the **maximum number of years** needed to traverse the wormhole consisting of `N` sectors numbered from `1` to `N`.

# Input data
The input file `startrek.in` will contain on the first line four natural numbers `N, p, q`, and `M`, separated by a space, with the meaning given in the statement. The following `M` lines contain the description of the `M` transmissions received by the Federation, in increasing order of years and sectors.

# Output data
The output file `startrek.out` will contain two lines. The first line will contain a non-zero natural number `A` which represents the **maximum number of sidereal years** required to traverse the `N` sectors. The second line will contain `N` values separated by a space which represent the **minimal lexicographical** temporal description of the traversed sectors, specifying the year for each sector.

# Constraints and clarifications
* `2 \leq N \leq 100 000`
* `2 \leq p < q \leq N`
* `1 \leq M \leq N`
* each sector must be traversed entirely within the same sidereal year;
* the entire journey must be completed within an integer number of sidereal years (in other words: traversing at least `p` sectors and at most `q` sectors is valid for the first and last year as well);
* there is always a solution for the input data;
* for `30` points `2 \leq N \leq 100`, `2 \leq p < q \leq 50`
* for `70` points `2 \leq N \leq 30 000`, `2 \leq p < q \leq 300`
* for `100` points `2 \leq N \leq 100 000`, `2 \leq p < q \leq N`

We know that the second sector is traversed in the first year. `1 1 2 2 3` cannot be a solution since in year `3` minimum `2` sectors are not traversed.
`2` years are necessary to traverse the `5` sectors. The first `3` sectors will be traversed in the first year, the next `2` sectors in the second year.

`3` years are necessary to traverse the `7` sectors.
The first `3` sectors will be traversed in the first year, the next `2` sectors in the second year, and the last `2` sectors in the third year.

Here is the translated and formatted competitive programming problem statement:

```markdown
Let `G` be an undirected graph with `2 \times N` nodes and `3 \times N - 2` edges. Each edge is colored in white, black, or red.

The following is guaranteed:
* There are `N - 1` white edges. Their endpoints are nodes from the set `1, 2, ..., N` . They form a tree.
* There are `N - 1` black edges. Their endpoints are nodes from the set `N + 1, N + 2, ..., 2 * N` . They form a tree.
* There are `N` red edges. Each edge has one endpoint in the set `1, 2, ..., N` and the other endpoint in the set `N + 1, N + 2, ..., 2 * N`.

The `2 \times N` endpoints of the red edges are distinct pairs. In other words, each node in the graph has exactly one incident red edge.

We call a special Hamiltonian cycle a cycle that:
* visits each node of the graph exactly once.
* does not traverse two consecutive edges of the same color.
* starts from node `1`, and the first edge traversed is red.

# Task
Display a special Hamiltonian cycle of the graph `G` or determine that there is no such cycle.

# Input data
The input file `dungeon.in` will contain:
- The first line contains a natural number `T` representing the number of tests.
- For each test, the first line contains the value `N`.
- The next `N - 1` lines contain pairs of values representing the endpoints of the white edges (values from `1` to `N`).
- The next `N - 1` lines contain pairs of values representing the endpoints of the black edges (values from `N + 1` to `2 \times N`).
- The next `N` lines contain pairs of values representing the endpoints of the red edges.

# Output data
The output file `dungeon.out` will contain for each of the `T` tests one line with `2 \times N` values representing the sequence of nodes that form the special Hamiltonian cycle of each given graph, or the value `-1` if there is no such cycle.

# Constraints and clarifications
* `N \leq 50\ 000`
* `T \leq 5`
* For tests worth `20` points, it is guaranteed that `N \leq 10`
* For other tests worth `30` points, it is guaranteed that both trees have the shape of a path.

Explanations
---

There are two tests.
In each test, the graph has `2*4` nodes and `3*4-2` edges (`3` white edges, `3` black edges, and `4` red edges).
In the first graph, there is no special Hamiltonian cycle.

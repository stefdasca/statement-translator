Given an array with $n$ integer elements, $a$, make the necessary changes so that the final array has the initial elements from the odd positions sorted in ascending order, and the ones from the even positions sorted in descending order.

# Task
The program is already written but contains a few bugs. Your task is to fix it. The program can be found [here](oddeven.cpp) or in the "Attachments" section on the side.

# Input data
Read from the terminal. The first line contains a natural number $n$ ($n \leq 1\ 000$), followed by the second line containing an array $a$, with $n$ integer elements, separated by spaces. Any number can be stored in an `int`.

# Output data
Print on a single line the modified array $a$, with the elements sorted as required. The displayed elements will be separated by a space.

# Constraints and clarifications
1) The sorting function headers and the counter step within them cannot be modified.
2) The content of the `do while()` loop in the `main()` function cannot be modified.
3) Lines of code cannot be added to the program, but existing lines of code can be deleted or modified (except for those in constraints 1 and 2).
4) Fun fact: You can solve the problem however you want. None of the above rules are checked, but during the contest they were probably checked.

# Example 1
`stdin`
```
5
6 2 3 5 10
```
`stdout`
```
3 5 6 2 10
```

# Example 2
`stdin`
```
6
10 7 3 2 5 6
```
`stdout`
```
3 7 5 6 10 2
```

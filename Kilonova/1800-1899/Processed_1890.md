It looks like the file 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 1890. Therefore, I don't have a competitive programming problem statement in Romanian to translate for you.

However, if you have a Romanian problem statement that you would like me to translate, please provide the text and I will be happy to help!

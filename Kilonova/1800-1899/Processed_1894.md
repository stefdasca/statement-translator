It appears that the content you have provided is not valid markdown text or Romanian content that can be translated according to your specified instructions. Instead, it seems to be an error message regarding an attachment that does not exist for a Problem ID.

The message indicates:
```
Attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 1894.
```

To assist you further, please provide the Romanian markdown content that you want to have translated. Once you provide the correct markdown content, I will be able to translate the programming problem statement as per your requirements.

> â€” Calm down a bit...

We have a ball that is on the $X$ axis, initially placed at coordinate $0$. There are also $N$ sets of walls on the $X$ axis. Each set is described as a triplet $(dir, len, freq)$, where:

* $dir$ indicates the direction in which the walls are placed, it can be either `L` (left) or `R` (right)
* if $dir=$ `L`, then the walls in the set are placed at positions $\displaystyle -len$, $\displaystyle -2 \cdot len$, $\displaystyle -3 \cdot len$, ..., $\displaystyle -freq \cdot len$
* if $dir=$ `R`, then the walls in the set are placed at positions $\displaystyle len$, $\displaystyle 2 \cdot len$, $\displaystyle 3 \cdot len$, ..., $\displaystyle freq \cdot len$

It is observed that due to the nature of this information, multiple walls may be placed at the same coordinate.

At time $T=0$ the ball starts to move to the right with a constant speed of one unit per second. When the ball hits a wall, the wall is automatically destroyed and the ball changes direction. If there are multiple walls at the same coordinate, only one of them will be destroyed.

# Task

There are $Q$ questions. For each question, an integer $T$ is given. Display the coordinate of the ball after $T$ seconds.

# Input data

The first line of the input will contain the integers $N$ and $Q$, separated by a space.

The next $N$ lines contain three integers separated by spaces, $dir$, $len$, and $freq$, describing how the walls are placed.

The next $Q$ lines contain one integer, $T$, describing a question. 

# Output data

Print $Q$ lines, the $i$-th line containing the answer to the $i$-th question.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N, Q \leq 250\ 000$
* $1 \leq T \leq 10^{12}$
* $dir \in \{`L`, `R`\}$
* $1 \leq len, freq \leq 10^{12}$

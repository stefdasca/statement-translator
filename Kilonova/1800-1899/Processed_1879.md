It seems there is no â€œstatement-ro.mdâ€ file available to translate. Your request includes processing a Romanian text file that outlines a competitive programming problem. However, without access to the content, it's not possible to provide a translation.

If you can provide the actual content of the problem statement in Romanian, I would be happy to help translate it to English while preserving the necessary formatting and detail.

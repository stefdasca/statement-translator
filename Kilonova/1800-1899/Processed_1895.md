It seems you provided a file attachment note which indicates an issue with the file `statement-ro.md` for Problem ID 1895, saying it does not exist. However, you mentioned you wanted to translate a competitive programming problem statement. Since the actual text of the problem statement wasn't provided or is inaccessible based on the note, I'm unable to perform the translation or processing directly.

To help you effectively, please provide the problem statement text (in Romanian), and I will translate it according to your specified instructions. If you have the text, please paste it here, and I'll take it from there!

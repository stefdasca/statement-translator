To ensure the success of a competition, it is essential that the proposed set of problems be as balanced as possible.

To ensure this, the Committee prepared $a$ easy problems, $b$ medium problems, and $c$ difficult problems. They know that they need to create enough problems for $k$ rounds.

# Task

Find the minimum number of additional problems that the Committee needs to create, knowing that a competition requires one easy problem, one medium problem, and one difficult problem.

# Input data

The first line will contain 4 natural numbers, $a$, $b$, $c$, $k$, with the significance given in the statement.

# Output data

The first line contains a single number, representing the number of additional problems that the Committee needs to create.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq a, b, c, k \leq 1 \ 000$

# Example 1

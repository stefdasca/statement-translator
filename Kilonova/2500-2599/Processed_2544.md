# Task

We are in an $N$-dimensional universe. What is the maximum number of points such that the distances between any 2 points are the same?

# Input data

The first line contains $N$.

# Output data

A single number, the maximum number of points.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$.

# Example

`stdin`
```
2
```

`stdout`
```
3
```

## Explanation

We are in a 2-dimensional plane, and we can choose a maximum of 3 points. If we place them in the form of an equilateral triangle, the condition is satisfied. We cannot choose more than 3 points such that there is a placement that respects the task.

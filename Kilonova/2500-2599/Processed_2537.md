It seems that the provided input text indicates that there is an issue with a missing file ('statement-ro.md') for a specific Problem ID. Here is the translation of the information given:

```
Attachment 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 2537.
```

It indicates that there is no attached file named 'statement-ro.md' for the Problem ID 2537. This message by itself does not offer any competitive programming problem statement to translate.

If you have the actual problem statement content in Romanian that you would like to translate, please provide it so I can assist you accordingly.

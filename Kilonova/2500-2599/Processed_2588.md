It seems like the file `statement-ro.md` for Problem ID 2588 does not exist. Without the specific content of the text that you would like translated, I cannot process it according to your instructions. If you can provide the actual problem statement text, I'd be happy to help translate it for you. Please copy and paste the Romanian problem statement here, and I will follow your instructions to translate it into English while preserving the specified format.

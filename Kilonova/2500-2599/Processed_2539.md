It looks like there was supposed to be a file named 'statement-ro.md' attached, but it's not available. Unfortunately, without the content of the problem statement in Romanian, I can't proceed with the translation.

If you can provide the competitive programming problem statement text here, I would be happy to assist with the translation as you've requested.

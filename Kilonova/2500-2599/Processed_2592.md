# Statement

$\mathbb{Mr. \ COACH}$ is testing your programming skills with a problem he solved in his youth, when his informatics skills were much lower than they are now. The problem sounds as follows:
Find the sum of integers between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive) that are not multiples of $A$ or $B$.

# Task

The input comprises a single line featuring three integers, denoted as $N$, $A$, and $B$, satisfying the inequalities $1 \leq N$, $A$, $B \leq 10^9$. These integers bear significance in accordance with the context provided in the problem statement.

# Input data

The input contains a single line featuring three integers, $N$, $A$, and $B$.

# Output data

Print the answer.

# Example 1

`stdin`
```
10 3 5
```

`stdout`
```
22
```

## Note

The integers between $1$ and $10$ (inclusive) that are not multiples of $3$ or $5$ are $1,2,4,7,$ and $8,$ whose sum is $1+2+4+7+8=22$.

# Example 2

`stdin`
```
1000000000 314 159
```

`stdout`
```

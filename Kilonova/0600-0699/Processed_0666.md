It seems like the file 'statement-ro.md' which contains the problem statement in Romanian does not exist. There was an error with the Problem ID 666. Therefore, I am unable to translate the content as requested.

If you have the text of the problem statement provided in another format or plain text, please share that instead and I will help you translate it accordingly.

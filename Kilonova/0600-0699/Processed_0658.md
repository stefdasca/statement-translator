It appears that there is no actual text content provided in your message aside from a notification that a markdown file named 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for a certain problem ID. There isn't any competitive programming problem statement in Romanian or other information to translate.

If you can provide the specific text content or the problem statement itself, I'd be happy to help you with the translation based on the instructions you described. Please provide the text that you need translated and edited.

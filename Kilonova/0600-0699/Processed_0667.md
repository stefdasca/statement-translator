It looks like the file `statement-ro.md` you referred to does not exist for Problem ID 667. As such, I'm unable to access specific content to perform the translation and formatting tasks you've outlined.

However, if you provide the text that you would like to have processed, I can certainly help you translate and format it according to your instructions. Please copy and paste the competitive programming problem statement here, and I will proceed with the task.

Here is the translated problem statement according to the specified instructions:

---

Miruna drew $N$ points with integer coordinates on the plane. Being inventive, she wants to give a new meaning to the concept of distance between two points. Thus, in her vision, the distance between two points with coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ will be equal to $min(|x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2|)$.

# Task

Write a program that determines the maximum distance between any two of the $N$ points drawn.

# Input data

The input file `dist.in` will contain on the first line the natural number $N$ representing the number of points. Each of the following $N$ lines will contain two integers separated by a space, representing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the drawn points.

# Output data

The output file `dist.out` will contain a single integer representing the maximum distance between any two points, as defined by Miruna.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$
* The coordinates of the points are integers in the interval $[-10^6, 10^6]$

# Example 1

`dist.in`
```
2
1 2
5 10
```

`dist.out`
```
4
```

## Explanation

We have only one pair, the distance between the two points being equal to $min(|1 - 5|, |2 - 10|) = 4$.

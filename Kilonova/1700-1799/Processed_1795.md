Andrei has discovered a mirror and now wants to see how it works. Thus, he will use a natural number $n$, which he received on his birthday, and wants to mirror it $k$ times, then tell you what value it will have.

# Task

Since Andrei is an impatient child, he wants you to provide the answer as quickly as possible!

# Input data

The first line will contain two natural numbers, $n$ and $k$.

The second line will contain $n$ non-zero digits, separated by a space, representing the digits of $n$.

# Output data

Print to the screen the number obtained after mirroring $k$ times. Do not display spaces between the digits of the number.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
* $1 \leq k \leq 10^9$

# Example

`stdin`
```
7 3
1 2 4 5 2 4 6
```

`stdout`
```
6425421
```

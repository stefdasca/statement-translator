Here is the translated text with the specified instructions and adjustments applied:

```
From a square surface with a side of $N$ units, composed of $N \cdot N$ small squares with a side of one unit, the $4$ squares from the corners are cut out.

# Task

Determine a way to cover the entire surface with pieces of area $4$ units that have the following shape:

~[acoperire.png]

The pieces can also be rotated or flipped, allowing us to use all $8$ modes of placing them.

# Input data

The input file `acoperire.in` contains on the first line a natural number $N$, with the meaning provided in the statement.

# Output data

The output file `acoperire.out` will contain the value $-1$ on the first line if the problem has no solution, otherwise, it will have the following structure: $N$ lines with $N$ values each, representing the encoding of the surface. The numbers on the same line are separated by a space. The positions occupied by the first placed piece will be encoded with $1$, the positions occupied by the second placed piece will be encoded with $2$, etc. Corresponding to the missing corners, the value $0$ will be written.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $6 \leq n \leq 200$
* The pieces must be completely inside the area;
* The area must be entirely covered;
* Two pieces cannot overlap completely or partially;

# Example

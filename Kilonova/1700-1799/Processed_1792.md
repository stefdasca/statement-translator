Since Andrei wants to become more cultured, he started watching international memes.

One day, he discovered a Japanese person who wasn't good at English, and seeing how he struggled with numbers, he thought about some possible scenarios.

# Task

Therefore, he now gives you various numbers and wants you to tell him how our hero would pronounce them.

Unlike in the video, our hero can only count correctly up to $10$. To make your job easier, we'll give you [the video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq01SLa6tFg).

# Input data

The first line contains a single integer $n$.

# Output data

The first line will contain a string $s$, which corresponds to the pronunciation of $n$, according to our Japanese hero.

# Constraints and clarifications

* $1 \leq n \leq 10^3$

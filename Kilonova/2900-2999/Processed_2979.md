It seems like the text content you've provided is not the competitive programming problem statement in Romanian, but rather an error message indicating that the file 'statement-ro.md' does not exist for Problem ID 2979.

If you are able to provide the actual competitive programming problem statement or if there is anything specific you need help with regarding this error, please let me know!

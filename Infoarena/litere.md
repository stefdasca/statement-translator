## Task

Miruna has written a sequence of $N$ lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet on a piece of paper. She wants to sort this sequence lexicographically. To achieve this, she can select any two adjacent characters and swap them. You are asked to determine the minimum number of swaps required to sort the sequence. 

## Input data

The first line of the input file `litere.in` contains a single integer $N$. The second line contains $N$ characters, representing the sequence written by Miruna on the paper.

## Output data

The output file `litere.out` will contain a single value on the first line, representing the minimum number of swaps needed.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 10000$ 

For $40\%$ of the tests $1 \leq N \leq 100$ 

## Example

`litere.in`
```

`litere.out`
```

### Secvdist

Poli is naturally a curious girl, so when she found a sequence of $N$ integers and a number $K$ on a piece of paper, she immediately wondered what the longest subarray in the sequence is, for which the difference between the maximum and minimum is at most $K$. However, Poli gets confused with very large numbers, so she is asking for your help.

## Task

## Input data

The input file `secvdist.in` contains two numbers on the first line, $N$ and $K$. The next line contains $N$ numbers representing the elements of the sequence.

## Output data

The output file `secvdist.out` will contain a single number, the length of the longest subarray for which the difference between the maximum and minimum is at most $K$.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 1\,000\,000$

$1 \leq K \leq 10^9$ 

The elements of the array are between $-10^9$ and $10^9$

## Example

`secvdist.in`

`6 3`

`2 1 5 2 3 3`

`secvdist.out`

`4`

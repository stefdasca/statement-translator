## Cake

On her birthday, Ionela made a triangular cake. Wanting to share it with her friends, Ionela makes $A$ cuts from one corner and $B$ cuts from another corner of the cake (a corner meaning a vertex of the initial triangle). After many such cuts, she is disoriented: how many triangular cake slices did she cut? By a slice, we mean a triangle with cuts on its sides and vertices at the intersections of the cuts. A slice can also contain other cuts inside.

## Task

Help Ionela count the triangular cake slices.

## Input data

The file `tort.in` contains on the first line the numbers $A$ and $B$ separated by a space.

## Output data

The file `tort.out` will contain one line with the number of cake slices.

## Constraints and clarifications

$0 \leq A$
$B \leq 2\ 000\ 000\ 000$

## Examples

`tort.in` `tort.out`
1 2 15
1 0 3

The following drawing corresponds to the last example: The three slices are: the large triangle (the whole cake) and the two smaller ones inside.

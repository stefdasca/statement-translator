## Task

Given a string, determine if the string has $2$ identical subsequences.

## Input data

The input file `dinozaur.in` will contain on its first and only line the string in question.

## Output data

Contain on the first line of the output file `dinozaur.out` a single number: $1$ if the string has $2$ identical subsequences or $0$ otherwise.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq$ Length of the string $\leq 10^5$

Consider that the first character of the string has index $1$.

The string will contain only lowercase letters of the English alphabet.

## Example

`dinozaur.in`

```
ampiramidepirapiramide
```

`dinozaur.out`

```
1
```

## Explanation

The subsequence "pira" appears $3$ times in the text. The recurring repetition of the phrase emphasizes the attachment of the lyrical self to the monument in question, thus becoming the leitmotif of the work.

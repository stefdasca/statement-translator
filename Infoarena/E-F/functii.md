## Task

During the mathematics class, Anca, the naughty girl, was not paying much attention while the teacher was explaining more advanced concepts about functions at the board. Upset by this, the teacher gave her a special task. She needs to count how many surjective functions defined on the set $\{ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \dots n \}$ with values in the set $\{ 0 , -1 , 1 \}$ exist such that $| f ( 1 )| + | f ( 2 )| + \dots | f ( n )| = S$ (all in absolute value). Help the poor girl and you will be rewarded (with 100 points).

## Input data

The file `functii.in` will contain the numbers $n$ and $s$ as defined above.

## Output data

The file `functii.out` will contain the number of functions that meet the condition from the statement. Since there can be quite a lot of functions, print the result modulo 30103.

## Constraints

$1 \leq n \leq 10000$

## Example

`functii.in` `functii.out`

$5$ $3$

$60$

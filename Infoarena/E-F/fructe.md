## Fruits

Following the dean's example, Miruna "borrowed" a tree from the biological research laboratory. This tree grows 2 types of fruits: oranges and bananas. Miruna wants to eat exactly 2 fruits each day. She noticed that if she eats 2 fruits of the same kind, an orange will grow on the tree overnight. If the fruits are of different types, a banana will grow instead.

## Task

Knowing how many fruits of each type were initially on the tree, determine which will be the last fruit left: a banana or an orange.

## Input data

The input file `fructe.in` will contain on the first line a single natural number $T$, representing the number of tests. The next $T$ lines will contain 2 integers $P$ and $B$, representing the number of oranges and bananas on the tree, respectively.

## Output data

The output file `fructe.out` will contain $T$ lines, each line containing $0$ if the last fruit left is an orange, or $1$ otherwise.

## Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 100$

$1 \leq P, B \leq 10^9$

For 40% of the tests $P, B \leq 100$

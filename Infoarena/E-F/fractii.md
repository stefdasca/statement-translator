# Fractions

One day while doing his math homework, Gigel started writing on a sheet of paper a series of irreducible fractions of the form $P / Q$ with $1 \leq P, Q \leq N$, where $N$ is a natural number chosen by him. For example, for $N = 4$ he obtained the following series: $1 / 1 1 / 2 1 / 3 1 / 4 2 / 1 2 / 3 3 / 1 3 / 2 3 / 4 4 / 1 4 / 3$. Gigel then started to count how many fractions he obtained for $N = 4$ and found that there are $11$.

## Task

Given a natural number $N$, determine how many fractions are in the series of fractions constructed according to the above rules.

## Input data

The input file `fractii.in` contains the natural number $N$ on the first line.

## Output data

The output file `fractii.out` must contain a natural number on the first line which represents how many fractions are in the series.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 1\ 000\ 000$

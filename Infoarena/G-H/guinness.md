# Guinness

Once upon a time; if it hadn't been, it wouldn't be told again from the time when grandfather told jokes and the board made up lies, from when the Russians fought over evaluators, from when competitors clutched at each other's throat over the score sheet, and reconciled by kissing, brotherhood style from when e.o.i.s. shod one leg with twenty-three *oca* of bread and threw himself into the sky, bringing us problems. In those days, while the world was under the magical control of various data structures, Father-Faithful, freshly retired, lived on Earth. He had 3 sons. We've already met the eldest and the middle son in the "Staropramen" problem, and we can easily deduce why they failed their father's test when he disguised himself as a complicated problem to scare them. The fortune to inherit the kingdom of Homeless-Emperor thus fell to the youngest son. Said and done. The youngest mounts his enchanted horse with Stepy-in-Forefront, whom he had previously fed some constants, and sets off. After many days of traveling, he reaches a forest of trees from which he didn't know how to get out and meets the Algorithmist Gypsy. Although his father had warned him that this guy deals with formulas, the youngest accepts his challenge to raise a number $A$ to the power of $B$ and display it modulo $M$.

## Input data

The input file `guinness.in` contains on the first line the number $T$. The next $T$ lines each describe a test in the format $A\ B\ M$.

## Output data

In the output file `guinness.out`, you will print the answer to the Algorithmist Gypsy's tasks. 

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq T \leq 10$  
$0 \leq A \leq 10^9$  
$1 \leq B \leq 100\ 000$  
$1 \leq M \leq 10^9$

The characters in the story are inspired by real life.

F-F-Father has an unconventional view on retirement.

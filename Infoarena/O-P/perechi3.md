## Task

Por Costel and Pairs

We are not sure how Por Costel managed to get to the IMF ball. The truth is he did. The dance floor is heated because Por Costel broke the air conditioning. On the dance floor, the boys and girls are quite clumsy. At the party, there are boys, with the $i$-th boy having a clumsiness degree of $b_i$. Additionally, there are girls at the party, with the $j$-th girl having a clumsiness degree of $g_j$. Por Costel observes that a boy-girl pair can dance only if $(clumsiness$ $of$ $the$ $girl$ $\times$ $clumsiness$ $of$ $the$ $boy)$ $\leq k$. Por Costel thinks that a slice of leek and a sack of oats would make a better dancing pair than those at this ball. However, he wonders how many boy-girl pairs at the party can actually dance.

## Input data

The input file `perechi3.in` will contain on the first line the number $t$ (the number of tests), and on each of the next $t$ lines will contain the number $k$.

## Output data

The output file `perechi3.out` will contain $t$ lines, with the answer to the $i$-th test on the $i$-th line.

## Constraints and clarifications

$t \leq 100$

$1 \leq n, m \leq 100$

$1 \leq b_i, g_j \leq 10^9$

$1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}$

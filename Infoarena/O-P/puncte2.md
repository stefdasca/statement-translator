## Task

On his 6th birthday, little Gigel received a convex polygon with $N$ vertices as a gift. Not knowing what else to do with it, Gigel started drawing lines between any two non-adjacent vertices. After drawing all possible lines, he noticed that any three of them do not intersect at the same point. Being naturally curious, he would like to know how many distinct points the diagonals he drew intersect. Determine the number of points where the diagonals of the polygon intersect.

## Input data

From the file `puncte2.in`, you will read the number $N$ of vertices of the polygon.

## Output data

In the file `puncte2.out`, you will print the number of intersection points.

## Constraints

$3 \leq N \leq 65 \ 535$

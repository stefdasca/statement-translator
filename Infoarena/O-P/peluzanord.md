## Task

Radu wants to buy tickets at Peluza Nord. He and his friends, who share strong opinions about numbers, would like to have only "cool" seats. A seat is called "cool" if the number written on it is divisible by the sum of its digits. Given an interval of seats $[A, B]$, Radu would like to know how many "cool" seats are in this interval. 

## Input data

The input file `peluzanord.in` contains the endpoints of the interval, $A$ and $B$. 

## Output data

The output file `peluzanord.out` will contain the required number. 

## Constraints

$1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{15}$

We observe that Radu has considerably more friends than Alex.

For $20\%$ of the tests $B-A \leq 10^6$

## Example

`peluzanord.in`
```
1 15
```

`peluzanord.out`
```
11
```

## Explanation

The $11$ numbers in the solution are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12$.

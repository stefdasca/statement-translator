Parallelograms

Clod is once again bored in math class and is playing by drawing parallelograms with vertices in the corners of grid squares. While drawing parallelograms, Clod wonders how many such parallelograms he can construct if he knows that the grid has $N$ rows and $M$ columns.

## Task

Help Clod solve the problem!

## Input data

The input file `parallelograms.in` contains on the first line two integers $N$ and $M$ separated by a space.

## Output data

The output file `parallelograms.out` will contain on the first line a single integer representing the number of parallelograms required in the problem.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N, M \leq 2000$

## Example

`parallelograms.in` `parallelograms.out`

```
2 2
```

```
22
```

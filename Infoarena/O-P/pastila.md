## The Pill

A pharmacist has a highly precise medicinal balance, capable of weighing weights between $1$ and $10^{100}$ grams. He has exactly one standard weight of $1$ g, $3$ g, $9$ g, $27$ g, $\dots$ etc. (all powers of $3$ expressed in grams). The pharmacist receives a pill and is asked to verify its weight. The weight of the pill is given as $X$. He needs to place weights on both sides of the balance to theoretically balance the pill. If the balance is level, the pill has the correct weight.

## Task

Indicate how the weights should be placed on the scales.

## Input data

The input file `pastila.in` contains a single number: the weight of the pill $X$.

## Output data

The output file `pastila.out` will contain two lines. The first line will contain the weights that need to be placed on the same scale as the pill, and the second line will contain the weights that need to be placed on the other scale. The order of the weights on the same line does not matter.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq X \leq 10^{100}$

## Example

`pastila.in`  
`34`

`pastila.out`  
`3 9 1`  
`27`

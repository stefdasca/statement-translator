# Puffs

For our friend Georgica, waiting for Santa Claus becomes increasingly tiring every passing day. However, he knows that fluffy treats have a beneficial effect against stress and fatigue. Therefore, he thinks it would be beneficial to eat some pufflets. He has three types of flavored pufflets available to eat: chocolate, cheese, and salt. Since the enjoyment of pufflets is an art in the true sense of the word, Georgica notes down the flavor each time he eats a pufflet. In the end, he wonders how many pufflets of each flavor he has eaten.

## Input data

The input file pufu.in contains on the first line the natural number $T$, representing the number of tests. Next, for each test, the first line will contain a natural number $N$, representing the total number of pufflets eaten by Georgica. On line $i$ of the following $N$ lines, there will be a string consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, representing the flavor of the $i$-th pufflet eaten by Georgica: "ciocolata", "cascaval" or "sare".

## Output data

The output file pufu.out will contain $T$ lines, and each line will contain 3 natural numbers, separated by a space, representing the number of chocolate, cheese, and salt flavored pufflets, in this order, savored by Georgica.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq T \leq 10$

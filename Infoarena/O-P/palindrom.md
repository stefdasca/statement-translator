# Palindrome

Consider a string consisting of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Transform the string into a palindrome of minimum length by inserting characters only at the end of the string.

## Input data

The input file $palindrom.in$ contains on the first line the string of characters.

## Output data

The output file $palindrom.out$ will contain on the first line the resulting palindrome obtained after the transformation.

## Constraints

The length of the string is at most $200\ 000$ .

## Example

`palindrom.in`
```
aabac
```
`palindrom.out`
```
aabacabaa
```

## Task

Ionel has rediscovered his youthful passion: divisors. He will give a natural number $N$ and will ask you to answer 2 questions. 
a) Specify a pair of numbers $(A, B)$ with the following properties: $A \cdot B = N$ and the greatest common divisor of the numbers $A$ and $B$ is maximum. 
b) Indicate the number of pairs that satisfy the task from point a).

## Input data

The input file `prodiv.in` will contain on the first line the number $N$.

## Output data

The output file `prodiv.out` will contain on the first line 2 numbers representing the answer to task a), and on the second line, a single number representing the answer to task b).

## Constraints

$1 \leq N \leq 10^{14}$

The pairs $(A, B)$ and $(B, A)$ are considered distinct if and only if $A$ is different from $B$.

## Example

`prodiv.in`

$3780$

`prodiv.out`

$210 \ 18$ 

$8$

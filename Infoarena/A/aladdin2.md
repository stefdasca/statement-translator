# Aladdin2

Aladdin thought at one point to go into the carpet business because he believes they are very profitable. He managed to solve all the technical problems and now he can create carpets of size $m \times n$. These carpets are divided into $m \times n$ cells of size $1 \times 1$. Each cell will be colored either white or black. Due to the fact that he wants to obtain carpets with certain magical properties, it is necessary that any square of size $2 \times 2$ contains two white cells and two black cells.

## Task

Aladdin wants to know how many different carpets, of size $m \times n$, that benefit from the magical properties can be constructed.

## Input data

The input file `aladdin2.in` contains on the first line two integers $m$ and $n$, separated by a single space, which represent the dimensions of a carpet.

## Output data

The output file `aladdin2.out` must contain a single line which will contain a single number representing the number of carpets of size $m \times n$ that can be constructed so that they benefit from the magical properties.

## Constraints

$2 \leq m \leq 10000$

$2 \leq n \leq 10000$

## Example

`aladdin2.in`
```
4 2
```

`aladdin2.out`
```

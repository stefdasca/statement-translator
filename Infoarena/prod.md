## Task

Iulia has a set of cards, each with a digit between \(1\) and \(9\) written on it. With these cards, Iulia wants to form two numbers such that their product is as large as possible. Unfortunately, she has too many cards, so she is asking for your help.

## Input data

The input file `prod.in` will contain on the first line \(9\) numbers separated by a space, representing the number of cards with the digit $1$, digit $2$, $\dots$, and respectively digit $9$ written on them.

## Output data

In the output file `prod.out`, you will print a single number representing the maximum product that can be obtained from two numbers formed from the given cards.

## Constraints and clarifications

The total number of cards will not exceed \(1000\).  
There will be at least \(2\) cards.  

## Example

`prod.in`  
`1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1`

`prod.out`  
`189`

## Explanation

Iulia has at her disposal cards with the digits $1$, $2$, and $9$. The two numbers that give the maximum product $189$ are $21$ and $9$. Attention: A number must be formed from at least one card.

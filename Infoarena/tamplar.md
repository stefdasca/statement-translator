## Tamplar

The young Ali Lalap, a fresh graduate from a prestigious academy, has found his dream job of being a carpenter. To pass the hiring interview, he must cut a board of length $L$ meters into $L$ pieces of 1-meter length each, making exactly $L-1$ cuts. However, the interview also includes a theoretical test that the young graduate must excel in to embark on a successful career, and this test consists of calculating in how many ways the board can be sectioned. You, driven by intrinsic motivation and notable ambition, aim for the same job and, equipped with solid PC operating skills, will do everything possible to solve the theoretical test before Ali.

## Input data

The input file `tamplar.in` contains a single natural nonzero number $L$, the length of the board.

## Output data

In the output file `tamplar.out`, you should print a single number representing the number of ways the board can be cut.

## Constraints and clarifications

$2 \leq L$  
$L \leq 10000$  

## Example

`tamplar.in tamplar.out`  
`3 2`  
`4 6`

## Explanation

For the first example:  
The first option is to make the first cut 1 meter from the left end, and the second cut 1 meter from the right end.  
The second option is to make the first cut 1 meter from the right end, and the second cut 1 meter from the left end.

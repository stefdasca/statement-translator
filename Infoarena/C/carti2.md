# Carti2

Mitruţ, the booted cat, wants to reorganize his library so that it can fit as many of the $N$ books he has as possible. Since he loves sleeping so much, he decided to give you this task and promises to reward you with 100 points if you help him. You know that the library has a height of $H$ and a width of $L$, and the thickness of each shelf is $G$. A shelf must be placed between any two adjacent rows of books you put in the library. Additionally, a shelf must be placed at the base of the library. The books Mitruţ owns can have different sizes; some are wider, others are taller. The height of book $i$ is $A_i$, and its width is $B_i$.

## Task

Determine the maximum number of books that fit into Mitruţ’s library and display the books you place in the library. If there are multiple solutions, display the smallest lexicographical solution. The order of the books on the shelves does not matter. 

## Input data

The first line of the input file `carti2.in` contains a natural number $T$ which represents the number of tests you need to evaluate. Next, each of the $T$ tests will be described. On the first line of each test, the natural numbers $N$, $H$, $L$ and $G$ with the meaning from the statement will be present. On each of the following $N$ lines, two natural numbers $A_i$ and $B_i$ will be given. On the $i + 1$ line of each test, the description of book $i$ will be present. 

## Output data

In the output file `carti2.out` you will print the answer for each test. On one line, the maximum number $N_{max}$ of books that fit in the library, and on another the description of the optimal solution, which is $N_{max}$ numbers sorted in ascending order by the sequence number of the books you choose.

## Constraints and clarifications

1 $\leq$ $T$ $\leq$ 10 

1 $\leq$ $N$ $\leq$ 12 

1 $\leq$ $H, L, G, A_i, B_i$ $\leq$ 1\ 000\ 000 

For 50% of tests $N$ $\leq$ 9 

A sequence $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_s$ is lexicographically smaller than another sequence $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_t$ if there exists $i \leq \min(s, t)$ such that $x_1 = y_1$, $x_2 = y_2$, $\dots$, $x_{i-1} = y_{i-1}$ and $x_i < y_i$.

## Explanation

For the first test, we can distribute the 4 books (1, 2, 7, and 8) as follows: books 1, 2, and 8 on the first shelf, and book 7 on the last shelf. 

For the second test, we can place books 1, 2, and 6 on the first shelf, and books 4 and 7 on the second shelf.

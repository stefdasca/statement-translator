Cal

Once upon a time in a special kingdom, there was a more special horse on a special chessboard represented by the Cartesian plane. This horse had the special property that instead of jumping a step with the pair $(1, 2)$, it jumped with any special pair $(a, b)$ with the property that $|a| + |b| = S$, a number known to all specialists. Also, another special peculiarity of this special kingdom was the existence of special fountains where our horse especially liked to bathe.

## Task

Given: a special starting point of the horse $(Sx, Sy)$, the number $S$, as the sum of distances for a special jump, and $N$ special fountains, respectively the coordinates of the special fountains. Determine how many fountains the special horse can bathe in with a single special jump.

## Input data

The input file `cal.in` will contain on the first line 4 numbers $Sx\, Sy\, S\, N$. The next $N$ lines of the input file will each contain 2 numbers $x$ and $y$ representing the coordinates of one fountain.

## Output data

In the output file `cal.out` will contain the number of fountains the horse can reach.

## Constraints

$3 \leq N \leq 200000$

Any other number in the input file will be in the range $[-100000000, 100000000]$

The word "special" was specially placed in the special locations where it appears.

## Example

`cal.in`

```
3 4 7 4
8 6
10 7
-3 3
-7 0
```

`cal.out`

```
2

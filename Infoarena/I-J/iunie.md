## Task

June... The smell of vacation is overwhelmingly pleasant. However, we have a problem for you: Given a natural number $N$, display the number of ways in which this number can be written as the sum of $2$ non-zero even natural numbers. Two ways of writing a number are considered distinct if at least one number in the two ways is different.

## Input data

The input file `iunie.in` contains the number $N$.

## Output data

The output file `iunie.out` will contain a single natural number, representing the number of ways in which $N$ can be written as the sum of $2$ non-zero even natural numbers.

## Constraints

$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

## Example

`iunie.in`
`iunie.out`

## Explanation

`4`
`1`

$4 = 2 + 2$

`2`
`0`

$2$ cannot be written as the sum of two non-zero even natural numbers.

`20`
`5$

$20$ can be written in the following ways: $2 + 18$, $4 + 16$, $6 + 14$, $8 + 12$, $10 + 10$. In total, $5$ ways.

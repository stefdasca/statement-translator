## Task

Stanislaw Ulam's symmetry game is played on a grid with $50 \times 50$ squares. Initially, a letter or two 'o' letters, in lowercase, are placed on one or two of the squares, respectively. Then, at each step of the game: On every square adjacent to only one square that contains a lowercase 'o' letter or a '*' character and is empty, a lowercase 'o' letter is placed. All lowercase 'o' letters from the previous step turn into '*' characters. The '*' characters existing before this step disappear. Two squares are adjacent if they share exactly one side.

## Task

Write a program that simulates this game on a given grid! The game ends after a step in which at least one letter is placed on the first or last row, or on the first or last column of the grid.

## Input data

The input file `joc14.in` contains:

- The first line contains a natural number $n$, representing the dimension of the grid.
- The next line contains the value $1$ or $2$, representing whether the game starts with one 'o' letter or with two.
- If this value is $1$, the next line contains two natural numbers separated by a space, representing the row and column indices of the position where the letter is located.
- If this value is $2$, the next line contains four natural numbers separated by a space, representing the row and column indices of the positions where the two letters are located.

## Output data

In the output file `joc14.out` you will "draw" the grid after each step, until the game ends. In the file, you will print a two-dimensional array of characters, corresponding to each step, where at the positions corresponding to empty squares you will write '.' characters, and elsewhere you will write 'o' or '*' characters. Between two different grids, a blank line will be left. If the first 'o' letter or at least one of the first two letters is positioned on the edge of the grid, no steps are performed, and the initial grid will be printed in the file.

## Constraints

$5 \leq n \leq 50$

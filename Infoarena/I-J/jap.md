Jap

J. Carpenter has the following problem to solve for his math class: Determine the number of distinct elements generated by the sequence $a^b$ ( $a$ to the power of $b$ ), for integers $a$ and $b$ with $1 \leq a \leq N$ and $1 \leq b \leq M$. His father, G. Carpenter I, looked over his son's homework and after having discovered the existence of computer science while building his desk in a past problem, decided to hand over the problem to you to solve for various values of $N$ and $M$.

## Input data

The input file `jap.in` contains on the first line the number $T$ of test cases. The following $T$ lines contain two natural numbers $N$ and $M$ on each line with the meanings described above.

## Output data

The output file `jap.out` will contain $T$ lines, one for each test case in the input.

## Constraints

$1 \leq T \leq 10\,000$

$1 \leq N, M \leq 100\,000$

20% of the tests used for evaluation will have $T = 1$ and $1 \leq N, M \leq 1\,000$

70% of the tests used for evaluation will have $T \leq 100$

Important

The number of different values of $M$ in the input file will not be greater than 30

## Example

`jap.in`
```
2
5 5
2 2
```

`jap.out`
```
19
3
```

## Explanation

For the second example, the generated sequence consists of the elements $1^1 = 1$, $1^2 = 1$, $2^1 = 2$, $2^2 = 4$. The number of distinct elements in this sequence is 3.

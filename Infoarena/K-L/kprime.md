## Task

Miruna likes only sequences that contain exactly $K$ prime numbers. For a sequence with $N$ elements, determine how many of its subarrays are to Miruna's taste.

## Input data

The input file `kprime.in` contains on the first line two natural numbers $N$ and $K$ having the meaning given in the statement. The second line will contain $N$ natural numbers representing the elements of the given sequence.

## Output data

In the output file `kprime.out` you will print the sought number.

## Constraints

$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$  
$1 \leq K \leq N$  
The elements of the sequence will be between $1$ and $1000$.

## Example

`kprime.in`
```
5 2
1 2 4 3 8
```

`kprime.out`
```
4
```

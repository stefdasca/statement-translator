# Take 5

Given an array of $N$ natural numbers and a number $S$, determine how many ways 5 elements can be taken from different positions in the array such that their sum is $S$. 

## Input data

The first line of the input file contains the numbers $N$ and $S$, and the next line contains the $N$ numbers. 

## Output data

The output file must contain the required number. 

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 1\ 000$

The numbers in the array are integers between $0$ and $400 \ 000 \ 000$

The number of possibilities is less than $2^{31}$ 

## Example

`take5.in`
```
6 5
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

`take5.out`
```
6
```

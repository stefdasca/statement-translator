## Task

Bianca has recently learned about coprime numbers at school. She loves number sequences and thought about combining both interests. Therefore, Bianca started wondering about how many subarrays exist in a sequence such that any two numbers in the subarray are coprime. She asks for your help because she likes very large sequences and can't answer her question by herself.

## Input data

The first line of the input file `sprim.in` contains the natural number $N$ representing the size of the sequence. The next line contains $N$ natural numbers.

## Output data

The only line of the output file `sprim.out` will contain the answer to Bianca's question.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$  
The numbers in the sequence will range between $1$ and $1\ 000\ 000 \ (10^6)$  
Subarrays of length 1 are not considered

## Example

`sprim.in`
`4`
`3 2 6 5`

`sprim.out`
`2`

## Explanation

The subarrays are: $3, 2$ and $6, 5$.

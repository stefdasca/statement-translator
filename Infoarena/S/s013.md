S013

Researchers in Russia have invented a new weapon which, lacking inspiration, they decided to name $S013$. To test it, they constructed a polygon (of size $N \times M$) with targets. The weapon can be placed in a position of the matrix where there is a target or a trace, aimed in a certain direction (North, South, East, West), and only then can it be fired. When a bullet passes through a square containing a target, it is destroyed and a trace is left in that place. A bullet from this weapon only stops when it reaches an empty area (without traces or targets). However, the weapon has a small problem. It can be used only a very limited number of times before it breaks.

## Task:

Considering that Russia has also been hit by the crisis, researchers want to find the minimum number of acts required to destroy all targets (so that the weapon can be used in as many experiments as possible).

## Input data

The input file `s013.in` will contain the numbers $N$ and $M$ on the first line. The next $N$ lines will contain $M$ characters each: `'.'` for an empty place and `'*'` for a target.

## Output data

The output file `s013.out` will contain on the first line the minimum number of acts required.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 50$

$1 \leq M \leq 50$

Assume the bullet passes through the position where the weapon is placed.

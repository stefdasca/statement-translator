Santa

HO HO HO$\dots$ Max Damage has arrived in Lapland, specifically at Santa Claus's toy factory. Now, everyone knows that Santa has a list of well-behaved children to whom he delivers toys on Christmas Eve, but$\dots$ let's just say Max Damage is no longer a child. He knows that the toys are ready and that the elves will need to transport them from their workshop (located at the intersection labeled $S$) to Santa's house (located at the intersection labeled $E$). Max Damage has a map of the city. It shows $N$ intersections, numbered from $1$ to $N$, connected by $M$ streets. Now Max Damage makes the following plan and needs our help. He knows that tomorrow the elves will transport the toys from the workshop to Santa's house. The problem is that he does not know the exact route the elves will take, but it is certain that they will not pass through an intersection more than once. All that's left for Max to do is to hop in his car and check all the intersections where the toy transport might be. Being economical, he should not pass through an intersection more than once or through intersections where it is certain that the toy transport cannot reach (let's be serious, gas is quite expensive). Thus, he will leave from his "headquarters" (the intersection labeled $Q$) passing through all and only the intersections where the toy transport could reach. Max's verification tour can end at any intersection.

## Task

If it is possible to make such a route, Max Damage needs one of them.

## Input data

The input file `santa.in` contains two integers $N$ and $M$ representing the number of intersections and streets, respectively. The next $M$ lines contain two numbers $X_i$ and $Y_i$ representing the existence of a two-way street between intersections $X_i$ and $Y_i$. The last line contains three numbers $S$, $E$, $Q$ as mentioned above.

## Output data

In the output file `santa.out`, you will print `No chance` if Max cannot achieve his plan for the given input file, or the number $X$ of intersections (on the first line) that need to be visited to achieve his plan, and on the next line the numbers $A_1$ $A_2$ $\dots$ $A_x$ separated by spaces representing the intersections, in the order in which Max Damage passes through for verification.

## Constraints and clarifications

1 $\leq$ $N$ $\leq$ $45\ 000$ 

1 $\leq$ $M$ $\leq$ $130\ 000$ 

No matter how we choose a set of $16$ or more intersections, there exist two intersections in the set $A$ and $B$ such that it is impossible to find a route that starts from $A$, passes through $B$, and returns to $A$ passing through an intersection at most once (the route can pass through any intersection, not necessarily through those in the chosen set).

## Task

The Ionescu family is getting ready to go to the theater. The mother hurriedly searches for clothes for the children. Meanwhile, the father, unhappy with the result of the game he was watching, throws the TV out the window, thus cutting off the electricity in the house (on the planet $Tarra$, electrical systems operate differently than those here). The mother, in front of the sock drawer, without any source of light, does not have time to look for a flashlight. She decides to pick the minimum number of socks to be sure that she makes all her children happy (each wants a pair of socks of the same color as the pairs of their siblings). 

## Input data

The first line of the input file `sosete.in` contains two natural numbers separated by space: $N$ - the number of members of the Ionescu family and $C$ - the number of distinct colors of socks in the drawer. 

## Output data

The output file `sosete.out` will contain a single natural number representing the minimum number of socks that Mrs. Ionescu needs to pick. 

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq C \leq 10^3$

$3 \leq N \leq 10^3$

For 50\% of the test cases, the number that needs to be printed in the output file will not exceed $2^{63} - 1$

It is considered that Mrs. Ionescu has an unlimited number of socks of any color

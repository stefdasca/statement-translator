# Prairie Dogs

The $K$ prairie dogs on the cheerful field want to shelter from the eagle in the $N$ burrows dug in the ground. The field will be the Euclidean plane, and the dens will be points with integer coordinates. To be protected from an eagle attack, they want to establish a safe zone in the shape of a quadrilateral, a zone where they can easily warn each other and hide at the appearance of an eagle. This zone must strictly contain at least $K$ burrows inside so that each prairie dog has its own burrow. Also, the vertices of the chosen zone must correspond to burrows. There should not be three collinear burrows.

## Task

Help the prairie dogs to determine the area of the minimum quadrilateral that meets the above conditions!

## Input data

The file `popandai.in` will contain on the first line the integers $N$ and $K$. The following $N$ lines will contain two integers $x_{i}$, $y_{i}$ separated by a space that represents the coordinates of a burrow.

## Output data

The first line of the output file `popandai.out` will contain a single real number representing the minimum area of the sought quadrilateral.

## Constraints and clarifications

$0 \leq K \leq N \leq 300$

$0 \leq x_{i}, y_{i} \leq 30000$

There are no three collinear points

The solution will be displayed with exactly one decimal place

There will always be a solution $(k + 3 < n)$

## Example

`popandai.in` 
```
8 0
5 9
9 6
8 1
0 7
7 2
1 3
2 0
8 3
```

`popandai.out`
```
2.0
```

## Explanation

The minimum area polygon is formed by the vertices $(7, 2)$, $(9, 6)$, $(8, 3)$, and $(8, 1)$.

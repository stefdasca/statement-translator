# Wbtree

We all know what a sieve is; we can use one to separate coarse flour from fine flour. However, in this problem, we will try to sieve the nodes of a tree. Nadgob the Sieve-Maker has a tree (an undirected, connected, acyclic graph) with $N$ nodes. Nadgob wants to choose a subset $S$ of the tree's nodes. To make this choice, he will sit, one by one, in $K$ distinct nodes of the tree. Once seated in a node $x$ of the tree, he can, as many times as he wants, select a node $y$ and "sieve" (i.e., add to $S$) all nodes $z$ for which $y$ lies on the shortest path between $x$ and $z$. Of course, a node already in $S$ will not be added again. Nadgob is now in a state of existential confusion. Full of anxiety, he wonders in how many ways he can choose the subset $S$ according to the procedure outlined above (modulo $10^9 + 7$). Two ways are considered distinct if the resulting subsets are distinct.

## Input data

The first line of the input file `wbtree.in` contains the numbers $N$ and $K$. The next $N - 1$ lines each contain a pair $a$ $b$, representing an edge in the tree. On the last line of the input, there are $K$ numbers, the indices of the nodes where Nadgob sits. 

## Output data

The single line of the output file `wbtree.out` will contain the required answer.

## Constraints

$1 \leq K \leq N \leq 10^5$

For 7 points, $1 \leq N * K \leq 20$

For another 9 points, $1 \leq N \leq 20$

For another 9 points, the tree contains at most one node of degree greater than 1.

For another 10 points, the tree contains no node of degree greater than 2.

For another 5 points, $K = 1$

For another 7 points, $K = N$

For another 6 points, $K = 2$

For another 7 points, $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$

## Explanation for the first example

Nadgob sits in node $0$. Selecting no $y$, results in $S = \{\}$. Selecting $y = 0$, results in $S = \{0, 1, 2\}$. Selecting $y = 1$, results in $S = \{1\}$. Selecting $y = 2$, results in $S = \{2\}$. Selecting $y = 1$ and $y = 2$, results in $S = \{1, 2\}$.

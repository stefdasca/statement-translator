Varu is very passionate about geometric shapes. He has $N$ small squares with side length of one unit. He wonders what is the shape with the minimum perimeter that can be constructed using all $N$ small squares. Your goal is to help Varu find the answer to this question that bothers him. 

## Input data

The file `chiftea.in` will contain on the first line $T$, the number of tests, and on the next $T$ lines, the number of small squares for each test. 

## Output data

The file `chiftea.out` will contain $T$ lines, each representing the minimum perimeter for all $T$ tests. 

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq T \leq 100.002$

$0 \leq N \leq 2\,147\,483\,647$

The small squares cannot overlap

By "shape", it is understood as a single geometric (connected) shape

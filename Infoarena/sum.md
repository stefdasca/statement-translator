## Task

Answer $N$ questions of the type: what is the sum of numbers $Y$ that are coprime with a number $X$, and which satisfy the property $0 \leq Y \leq 2X$.

## Input data

The first line of the input file `sum.in` contains an integer $N$. 
The following $N$ lines each contain a number $X$. 

## Output data

In the output file `sum.out` you will print $N$ lines, representing, in order, the answers for the tests from the input file.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000$

$2 \leq X \leq 100\ 000$ 

## Example

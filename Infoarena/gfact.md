## GFact

## Task

Given a natural number $A$, find the smallest natural number $B$ such that $B!$ divides $A$. 

## Input data

The input file contains on the first line two integers separated by a space, $P$ and $Q$, such that $A = P^Q$. 

## Output data

The output file will contain the natural number $B$ with the property described in the statement. 

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq P \leq 2\ 000\ 000\ 000$

$1 \leq Q \leq 30\ 000$

For 70% of the tests $Q = 1$, of which 30% have $P \leq 1\ 000$ 

## Example

`gfact.in` 
`gfact.out` 
2 3 
4 

## Explanation

$A = 2^3 = 8;$ $4! = 24$ (which divides $8$)

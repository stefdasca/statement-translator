# Picazo

Picazo, a proud artist of his art, but prouder of drinking hot milk, realized that he ran out of money, so he is forced to return to his secondary passion. Initially, he only has a completely white painting composed of $N$ adjacent $1 \times 1$ cells. For $K$ money, he can buy a can of paint to paint one of the painting's cells completely. His client will pay him based on the painting's beauty. The beauty of the painting is determined by the sum of the beauties of $Q$ intervals chosen by the client. The beauty of an interval is determined by the number of distinct colors present in that interval, including the initial white.

## Input data

The input file `picazo.in` will contain on the first line the numbers $N$, $K$, and $Q$ with the meanings from the statement. Each of the following $Q$ lines will contain $2$ numbers each, representing the endpoints of the intervals chosen by the client.

## Output data

The output file `picazo.out` will contain on the first line the maximum profit obtained by Picazo from selling the painting.

## Constraints and clarifications

There are at least $100\ 000$ distinct colors.
$1 \leq N$, $K$, $Q \leq 100\ 000$
For $20$ points, $N$, $Q \leq 20$
For another $40$ points, $N$, $Q \leq 2\ 000$
For the remaining $40$ points, $N$, $Q \leq 100\ 000$

## Example

1 2
2 3
2 3
3 4
3 4

```

`picazo.out`
```

```

`picazo.in`
```
5 1 3

```

`picazo.out`
```

```

## Explanation

In the first example, we will color cells $2$ and $4$ with blue and red, respectively. The painting cost will be $2$, and the money received for the painting will be $2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12 \Rightarrow$ The total profit is $12 - 2 = 10$.

In the second example, we will color all the cells, thus we will have a profit of $5 + 5 + 5 - 4 = 11$.

Por Costel and Azerah

Por Costel received a royal invitation to the emperor of programming's palace, Azerah. Azerah heard about the famous pig and wanted to see him with his own eyes. Por Costel, upon arriving at the palace, tells the emperor that "he looks good enough to eat". Azerah feels insulted (although Por Costel meant it as a compliment) and, infuriated to his core, threatens our friend with death if he does not provide a solution to a counting problem that had been bothering him for some time: Given a sequence of numbers, how many non-empty subsequences have an even sum? Help Por Costel escape from this predicament!

## Input data

The input file $azerah.in$ will contain the first line with $n$, the number of tests. A test has the following format: the first line contains $k$ (the number of numbers) and the following line contains the $k$ numbers.

## Output data

The output file $azerah.out$ will contain $n$ lines, where line $i$ contains the answer to question $i$. Print the result modulo $10^9 + 7$ (Azerah wonâ€™t notice anyway).

## Constraints

$1 \leq n \leq$ the sum of all $k$s $\leq 10000$

$1 \leq$ each number in the sequence $\leq 1000000000$

```
2

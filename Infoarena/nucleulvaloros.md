# Valuable Core

Upset that it was rejected in the stories from ONI 2015, the Valuable Core decided to make its grand debut at ONIS 2015. Given an array with $N$ elements, we define the valuable core of a subarray as the maximum value in that subarray. Knowing the valuable core for each subarray of length $K$ in the array (there are $N - K + 1$ subarrays of length $K$), your task is to generate an array of length $N$ that satisfies all the $N - K + 1$ conditions. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.

## Input data

The input file `nucleulvaloros.in` will contain $T$ on the first line (the number of tests). The first line of each test will contain $2$ natural numbers $N$ and $K$. The next line will contain $N - K + 1$ values, the $i$-th value representing the valuable core for the subsequence $[i, i + K - 1]$.

## Output data

The output file `nucleulvaloros.out` will contain $T$ lines, with line $i$ containing the answer for test $i$. Each line will contain $N$ (the $N$ for the respective test) natural numbers (strictly greater than $0$) representing the array generated by you for that test.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq T \leq 20$ 

$1 \leq K \leq N \leq 50000$ 

Values in the input will be natural numbers in the interval $[1, 1000000000]$ 

If there is no solution, print $-1$.

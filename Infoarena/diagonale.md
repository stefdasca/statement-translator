# Diagonals

A square matrix of size $N\times N$ is given. The task is to find the diagonal with the maximum sum. By diagonal, besides the main and secondary diagonals of the matrix, we refer to any set of elements situated on a line parallel to one of these.

## Task

## Input data

The input file `diagonale.in` will contain on the first line the number $N$, and on the next $N$ lines there will be $N$ elements each, representing the matrix description.

## Output data

The output file `diagonale.out` will contain a single number, representing the required value.

## Constraints

$1 \leq N \leq 1000$  
The elements of the matrix will be integers less than $10^9$ in absolute value.

## Example

`diagonale.in`
```
3
1 2 3
4 5 6
1 12 9
```

`diagonale.out`
```
18
```

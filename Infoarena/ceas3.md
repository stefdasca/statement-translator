# Clock3

The planet Romania is shaped like a plate, and the sun is a point source that revolves around it in a perfectly circular trajectory, maintaining a constant distance from it. The philosopher Gali Leo observed that the sun completes a full rotation around the planet Romania in $12$ hours. He built a clock by placing a fixed pillar in the middle of the planet, and its shadow indicates the exact time (a day starts at $00:00$ and ends at $11:59$). Given the angle formed by the shadow of the pillar with the half-line that symbolizes $09:00$, in a counterclockwise direction, display the current time in digital format $hh:mm$. 

## Input data

The input file `ceas3.in` contains multiple tests, each on a separate line, each one being determined by an integer representing the angle measured in degrees.

## Output data

The output file `ceas3.out` will contain, on each line, in order for each test, the determined time in the format $hh:mm$. 

## Constraints and clarifications

$0 \leq angle < 360$

## Example

`ceas3.in` 
``` 
0 
90 
```

`ceas3.out`
``` 
09:00 
00:00 
```

Babacu

The tribe of Unit silver cannibals have captured Babacu'. To give him no chance of escape, each of the $n$ village elders have constructed an infinite wall. Babacu', a curious man by nature and weak in mathematics, wants to know how many walls can be seen from his position.

## Input data

The input file `babacu.in` will contain on the first line a natural number $N$, the number of members in the village council. On the next $N$ lines, there will be $3$ numbers, $A$, $B$, $C$ representing the equations of the lines that represent the walls (of the form $A \cdot x + B \cdot y + C = 0$).

## Output data

The output file `babacu.out` will contain a single natural number $Z$ representing the number of walls that Babacu can see.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 10000$

A wall is not considered if it is visible at a single point

Babacu' is located at the coordinates $(0,0)$

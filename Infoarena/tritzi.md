# Tritzi

A trit is a logical unit that can take 3 values: $0$, $1$, and $2$. Trits can be used exactly like bits (which youâ€™ve probably heard of). For example, information can be transmitted as sequences of trits. To avoid confusion with bit sequences, trit sequences have a special property: two trits with the values $0$ and $1$ respectively cannot be transmitted one after another. Thus, there are valid and invalid trit sequences (which contain at least one pair of adjacent trits equal to $0$ and $1$). For example, the sequence $02212212000211$ is a valid sequence, but the sequences $0122212$ or $2221022$ are not valid. Determine the number of valid trit sequences of length $N$. Since this number can be very large, we are only interested in its value modulo a number $P$.

## Task

## Input data

The first line of the input file `tritzi.in` contains the integer $T$, representing the number of upcoming tests. The next $T$ lines contain $2$ integers each: $N$ and $P$. 

## Output data

For each test in the input file, you will print in the output file `tritzi.out` a number representing the requested value.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq T \leq 30$

$1 \leq N \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$

$1 \leq P \leq 32\ 000$

## Example

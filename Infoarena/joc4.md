## Joc4

Two people participate in a game. On the game board, a connected, undirected graph with $N$ vertices is represented. Each player is associated with a specific vertex. In each round, one of the players must find a path from their node to the opponent's node. At the moment a player finds such a path, it is the opponent's turn to move. Nodes that have been traversed can no longer be used in the construction of another path (with the exception of the nodes associated with the players). A round is complete if the player manages to determine a path from their node to the opponent's node. Any incomplete round ends the game. Given the graph on which the game takes place, determine the maximum number of complete rounds that can be finished.

## Input data

The first line of the input file `joc4.in` contains four integers $N$, $M$, $A$, and $B$. $N$ represents the number of nodes in the graph, $M$ the number of edges, and $A$ and $B$ the vertices associated with the two players. The next $M$ lines each contain two values $x$ and $y$, indicating that in the graph there exists an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$.

## Output data

The output file `joc4.out` will contain the number of complete rounds that can be played.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 250$

$1 \leq M \leq 5\ 000$

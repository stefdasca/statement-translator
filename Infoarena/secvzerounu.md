## Task

Zoe, the princess with pink eyes, bored with her courtiers, has started playing a new game on her phone, *secvzerounu crush*. In this game, a sequence of binary digits is initially equal to $0$. When Zoe presses a $0$, it is replaced by the sequence $01$, and when she presses a $1$, it is replaced by the sequence $10$. She wonders: for $T$ sequences of binary digits, can we generate them in the game *secvzerounu crush*?

## Input data

The input file `secvzerounu.in` will contain on the first line the number $T$. On the next $T$ lines, the binary sequences of interest will appear.

## Output data

In the output file `secvzerounu.out`, $T$ lines will appear, each containing the answer for a binary sequence. If the sequence can be generated, the line will contain $Da$. Otherwise, the line will contain $Nu$.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq T \leq 1\,000\,000$

The total number of characters in the file $\leq 1\,000\,000$

## Example

*secvzerounu.in*
```
2
0
10
```

*secvzerounu.out*
```
Da
Nu
```

## Explanation

$0$ can be generated without performing any operation. $10$ cannot be generated by any sequence of moves.

## Task

Boolanel has recently become passionate about bits. He is seriously (typically Boolanel) considering the following problem: How many sequences of $N$ bits with a maximum of $K$ consecutive $0$ bits exist? Determine the answer to Boolanel's question.

## Input data

The input file `nkbiti.in` will contain a single line which contains two natural numbers $N$ and $K$ separated by a space.

## Output data

The output file `nkbiti.out` will contain a single line with the desired answer for Boolanel. Since this answer can be very large, Boolanel asks you to print the answer modulo $666777$.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 1\,000\,000\,000$

$1 \leq K \leq 40$

For $40\ \%$ of the tests $N \leq 100\,000$

For $60\ \%$ of the tests $N \leq 6\,000\,000$

## Example

`nkbiti.in`
```

`nkbiti.out`

## Task

Given a strictly positive natural number $N$, determine a sequence $S$ of strictly positive natural numbers whose sum is $N$ and which contains a maximum number of unique elements. An element of the sequence $S$ is unique if it appears only once in the sequence.

## Input data

The first (and only) line of the input file `maxunice.in` contains the strictly positive natural number $N$.

## Output data

The first line of the output file `maxunice.out` should contain the number $K$ of elements in the sequence $S$. Each of the following $K$ lines should contain one element of the sequence.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 2\,000\,000\,000$

## Example

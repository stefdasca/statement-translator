# Metrou4

Four years ago, Jones was elected mayor of an important city. In the meantime, Jones failed to implement any of his electoral promises. To avoid losing the upcoming elections, he decided to propose a plan to connect the city's most important $N$ locations with subway lines. The main problem encountered is that the robot purchased without a tender to create underground tunnels can only move in straight lines, to the north, south, east, or west. The cost of a plan is given by the total distance of the dug tunnels. Jones asks you to help him establish a minimum cost plan so that it is possible to reach any location from any other location using the subway.

## Input data

The input data is read from the file `metrou4.in`. The first line contains the number of tests, $T$. Each test will begin with the number of locations $N$. The next $N$ lines are in the form $X$ $Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are integers, representing the coordinates of a location.

## Output data

The output file is `metrou4.out`. For each test, print on a separate line an integer representing the minimum cost to implement the plan.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq T \leq 12$  
$1 \leq N \leq 150\ 000$  
$0 \leq X,Y \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$  
It is possible to dig a tunnel between any two locations. Each tunnel is distinct; it is not possible to reuse a section of a previously dug tunnel to connect two locations.

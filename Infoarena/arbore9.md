### Arbore9

X wants to take a trip in a tree-shaped city with $N$ nodes. For each edge from $u$ to $v$, the beauty coefficient $a$ of traversing the edge from $u$ to $v$ and the beauty coefficient $b$ of traversing the edge from $v$ to $u$ are known ($a$ and $b$ are integers). X can travel in any direction along the treeâ€™s edges, but in the end, they will only remember the last time they visited each edge. The total coefficient is the sum of the coefficients of the edges that X remembers visiting. To decide from which node to start the trip, X asks you to find the maximum total coefficient that can be obtained starting from each of the $N$ nodes.

## Input data

The input file `arbore9.in` contains on the first line the number $N$ of tree nodes. The next $N-1$ lines contain 4 numbers representing an edge: $u_i$, $v_i$, $a_i$, $b_i$.

## Output data

The output file `arbore9.out` will contain, on a single line, $N$ numbers separated by a space, the $i$-th number representing the maximum cost obtained starting from node $i$.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 100\ 000$

$1 \leq u_i , v_i \leq N$

$-1\ 000\ 000\ 000 \leq a_i , b_i \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$

For 30 points,

$1 \leq N \leq 1000$

For another 20 points,

$0 \leq a_i , b_i \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$

## Example

`arbore9.in`
```
8
1 2 2 2
2 3 0 -5
2 4 -1 3
4 5 5 5
2 4 6 4
2 1 7 3
1 7 8 -1 -3
```

`arbore9.out`
```
12 12 10 12 12 12 12 11
```

## Explanation

Starting from node $1$, a path with the maximum total coefficient is: $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 7$

Only the coefficients of the bolded edges will be added to the total coefficient.

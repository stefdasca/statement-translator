## Task

Mr. IOI, Nry, and Semicircle are tired of problems with long statements that turn out to be EZ. Therefore, they will give you a formal statement: We call a sequence $a$ a gcd-sequence of length $N$ if it can be generated based on another sequence $b$ of length $N$ according to the rule: $a_i = \text{gcd}(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_i)$. The gcd function returns the greatest common divisor of the parameters. For example, the sequence $6 \ 3 \ 3$ is a gcd-sequence because it is generated by the sequence $6 \ 9 \ 24$. Count how many gcd-sequences of length $N$ exist, having elements between $1$ and $K$, modulo $1.000.000.007$. Note that it does not matter in how many ways these can be generated, only how many final sequences exist.

## Input data

The input file `sirgcdx.in` contains the numbers $N$ and $K$ on a single line.

## Output data

The output file `sirgcdx.out` contains the answer, modulo $1.000.000.007$.

## Constraints

Subtask 1 (test 1) - 5 points (test 1):
$1 \leq N, K \leq 5$

Subtask 2 (tests 2 - 3) - 10 points (tests 2 and 3):
$1 \leq N, K \leq 10^2$

Subtask 3 (tests 4 - 6) - 15 points (tests 4-6):
$1 \leq N, K \leq 10^3$

Subtask 4 (tests 7 - 10) - 20 points (tests 7-10):
$1 \leq N, K \leq 10^5$

Subtask 5 (tests 11 - 14) - 20 points (tests 11-14):
$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$
$1 \leq K \leq 10^5$

Subtask 6 (tests 15 - 20) - 30 points (tests 15-20):
$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$
$1 \leq K \leq 10^6$

Anyone who is naughty and asks where the 'x' in the title comes from might not get 100 points.

## Explanation

For the first example, the sequences are: $(2,2,2)$, $(2,2,1)$, $(2,1,1)$, $(1,1,1)$.

The first sequence can be generated based on the sequence $(2,2,2)$, the second by the sequence $(2,2,1)$, the third by the sequence $(2,1,2)$, and the fourth by the sequence $(1,2,2)$. Note that there are also other sequences that can generate some of these sequences (for example $(1,1,1)$ can also be generated by the sequence $(1,2,1)$).

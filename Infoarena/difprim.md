Difprim

Costica learned about prime numbers at school and received the following assignment: given an interval $[a, b]$, determine two consecutive prime numbers within this interval whose difference is maximum. If there are multiple solutions, the smallest two numbers should be displayed. If there is no solution, the value $-1$ should be displayed.

## Task

Determine two consecutive prime numbers within the interval $[a, b]$ whose difference is maximum. If there are multiple solutions, display the smallest two numbers. If there is no solution, display the value $-1$.

## Input data

The input file `difprim.in` contains on the first line two numbers, $a$ and $b$, representing the given interval.

## Output data

In the output file `difprim.out`, you will print the two consecutive prime numbers with the maximum difference.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^7$

For $40\%$ of the tests:

$1 \leq A \leq B \leq 100001$

## Example

`difprim.in`

```
40 50
```

`difprim.out`

```
43 47

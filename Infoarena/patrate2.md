# Patrate2

Andrei is a very diligent student in mathematics. He always finds new exercises and asks the teacher for help when needed. This time, however, Andrei puzzled the teacher with the following problem: Let $A$ be a matrix with $N$ rows and $N$ columns. The task is to find the number of ways to fill matrix $A$ with elements from the set $\{-1, 1, -5, 5\}$ such that the product of the numbers in each row or column is $-5$ or $5$. Not knowing how to solve the problem, the teacher calls for your help.

## Task

Determine the number of ways to fill matrix $A$ under the given conditions.

## Input Data

The file `patrate2.in` contains one line that contains the number $N$, representing the number of rows and columns of the matrix $A$.

## Output Data

The file `patrate2.out` contains a single line that will contain the required number.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N \leq 100$

The matrix $A$ must be completely filled (no elements should be left empty).

## Examples

`patrate2.in`
```
1
```
`patrate2.out`
```
2
```

## Explanations

There are two possibilities: $(5)$ and $(-5)$.

`patrate2.in`
```
2
```
`patrate2.out`
```
32
```

## Explanations

Trust me, this is the answer.

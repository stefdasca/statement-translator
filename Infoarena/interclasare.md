## Task

Given two arrays of integers: $A$ with $N$ elements and $B$ with $M$ elements. Find the longest increasing subsequence that can be obtained by merging these two arrays. Recall that a merge of two arrays $A = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N)$ and $B = (b_1, b_2, \dots, b_M)$ is an array $C = (c_1, c_2, \dots, c_{N+M})$ which contains all elements of $A$ and $B$ such that $a_i$ appears before $a_j$ and $b_i$ appears before $b_j$ in $C$ for any $i < j$. By "increasing subsequence" we mean a subsequence $D = (c_{i_1}, c_{i_2}, \dots, c_{i_k})$ such that $i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k$ and $c_{i_1} \leq c_{i_2} \leq \dots \leq c_{i_k}$.

## Input data

The first line of the file `interclasare.in` contains the number $N$ representing the number of elements of the first array.

The second line contains $N$ numbers representing the elements of the first array.

The third line contains the number $M$ representing the number of elements of the second array.

The next line contains the $M$ elements of the second array.

## Output data

The first line of the file `interclasare.out` will contain the length of the longest increasing subsequence that can be obtained by merging the two arrays from the input file.

The second line will contain $N + M$ numbers representing the array $C$, that is, the arrays $A$ and $B$ merged in such a way that the longest common subsequence in array $C$ has maximum length.

## Constraints and clarifications

$1 \leq N, M \leq 10\,000$

$0 \leq a_i \leq 30\,000$ for any $1 \leq i \leq N$

$0 \leq b_i \leq 30\,000$ for any $1 \leq i \leq M$

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them

You will receive partial scores on each test as follows:

40% of the score if the first line is correct.

100% of the score if both lines are correct.

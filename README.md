# Romanian Competitive Programming Problem Statement Translator

by [Stefan Dascalescu](https://stefdasca.ro)

Here you can find accurate translations for Romanian competitive programming problems into English, without facing common pitfalls in the process, by relying on the power of artificial intelligence (mainly, large language models such as ChatGPT) and various scripts, the with more than 6000 problems being translated across Infoarena and Kilonova.

This script, together with the GPT Prompt, can be used to read the Romanian statements. 

For [kilonova](https://kilonova.ro), if you are solving the problem numbered $x$, you can check in the corresponding folder (each group of $100$ tasks is separated for simplicity) the statement named Processed_x.md 

For [infoarena](https://infoarena.ro), if you are solving the problem named $x$, you can check in the folder corresponding to its first letter the statement named x.md (if the link is https://infoarena.ro/problema/flip, you should find flip in the folder corresponding to letter F)

## Disclaimers

* Even though I uploaded problems to both websites over the years, I am not and I have never been part of [Infoarena's](https://infoarena.ro) or [Kilonova's](https://kilonova.ro) staff, and this effort is purely **unofficial**. If any of the websites is using some or all of my efforts for future improvements, I welcome them as the sole purpose of this project is to help competitive programmers worldwide have easier access to a large database of Romanian problems.
* Some of the statements might contain inconsistencies and/or small errors, they will be solved as I will find them. If you spot any error, please create an issue or contact me using the info on [my website](https://stefdasca.ro)
* The statements already in English language don't have their markdown here.
* Some rendering is still poorly done, especially for Infoarena where some of the sample inputs and outputs are often misplaced or poorly formatted (for these problems, please check the original statement)
* **UPD**: Infoarena problem translation is supported, translations will be added as I get to translate various sections (monthly section was translated), campion.edu.ro and pbinfo can be added too later
* If a problem shows up in multiple online judges (primarily with the problems present [here](https://github.com/roalgo-discord/Romanian-Olympiad-Solutions)), they will only be found in the kilonova section as every Romanian Olympiad problem is present on this website.

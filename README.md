# Romanian Competitive Programming Problem Statement Translator

This is a project I've been working on as I wanted to provide the best versions of English statements for various Romanian competitive programming problems for my students. 

The purpose of the project was to translate various Romanian problems without facing common pitfalls in the process, by relying on the power of artificial intelligence (mainly, large language models such as ChatGPT) and various scripts, instead of manually translating what would be roughly $3000$ or even $4000$ statements manually.

This script, together with the GPT Prompt, can be used to read the Romanian statements. 

For [kilonova](https://kilonova.ro), if you are solving the problem numbered $x$, you can check in the corresponding folder (each group of $100$ tasks is separated for simplicity) the statement named Processed_x.md 

For [infoarena](https://infoarena.ro), if you are solving the problem named $x$, you can check in the corresponding folder the statement named x.md 

## Disclaimers

* Even though I uploaded problems to both websites over the years, I am not and I have never been part of [Infoarena's](https://infoarena.ro) or [Kilonova's](https://kilonova.ro) staff, and this effort is purely **unofficial**. If any of the websites is using some or all of my efforts for future improvements, I welcome them as the sole purpose of this project is to help competitive programmers worldwide have easier access to Romanian problems.
* Some of the statements might contain inconsistencies and/or small errors, they will be solved as I will find them. If you spot any error, please create an issue or contact me using the info on [my website](https://stefdasca.ro)
* The statements already in English language don't have their markdown here.
* Some rendering is still poorly done
* **UPD**: Infoarena problem translation is supported, translations will be added as I get to translate various sections (monthly section was translated), campion.edu.ro and pbinfo can be added too later
* If a problem shows up in multiple online judges (primarily with the problems present [here](https://github.com/roalgo-discord/Romanian-Olympiad-Solutions)), they will only be found in the kilonova section as every Romanian Olympiad problem is present on this website.

# statement-translator

This is a project I've been working on as I wanted to provide the best versions of English statements for various competitive programming problems for my students. 

The purpose of the project was to translate various Romanian problems without facing common pitfalls in the process, by relying on the power of ChatGPT, instead of manually translating what would be roughly $3000$ or even $4000$ statements manually.

This script, together with the GPT Prompt, can be used to read the Romanian statements. 

For [kilonova](https://kilonova.ro), if you are solving the problem numbered $x$, you can check in the corresponding folder (each group of $100$ tasks is separated for simplicity) the statement named Processed_x.md 

## Disclaimers

* Some of the statements might contain inconsistencies and/or small errors, they will be solved as I will find them. If you spot any error, please create an issue or contact me using the info on [my website](https://stefdasca.ro)
* The statements already in English language don't have their markdown here.
* Some rendering is still poorly done
* Other Romanian online judges will soon come too as I figure out a way to process their statements

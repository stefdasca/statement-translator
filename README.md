# statement-translator

This is a project I've been working on as I wanted to provide the best versions of English statements for various competitive programming problems for my students. 

The purpose of the project was to translate various Romanian problems without facing common pitfalls in the process.

This script, together with the GPT Prompt, can be used to read the Romanian statements. 

For [kilonova](https://kilonova.ro), if you are solving the problem numbered $x$, you can check in the corresponding folder the statement named Processed_x.md

Other online judges will soon come too.

Please process the following text according to the specified instructions: You will be given a competitive programming article in markdown, written in the Romanian language, using GFM extensions and MathJax/LaTeX math between dollar signs ($ or $$). Another extension is the fact that image attachments are defined using a syntax similar to ~[name.png], with optional attributes named after the end with a vertical bar ('|'). You must translate the article in the English language, while preserving mathematical values, variable names, general syntax, structure and format. You must also preserve the custom image format exactly as is. The word Cerință task is always translated to Task, Date de intrare is translated to Input data, Date de ieșire is translated to Output data, subsecvență is translated to subarray, subșir is translated to subsequence, Restricții și precizări to Constraints and clarifications, vector is translated to array. When separating large integers (especially in latex/mathjax math) in groups of 3 digits, do not add a comma. Instead, add a backslash followed and preceded by a single space character. After you are done with translating, please double check the statement and fix potential grammar and/or syntax errors according to the rules of English language..
